Selective uptake in multicellular organisms critically requires epithelia with extracellular diffusion barriers. In plants, such a barrier is provided by the endodermis and its Casparian strips—cell wall impregnations analogous to animal tight and adherens junctions. Interestingly, the endodermis undergoes secondary differentiation, becoming coated with hydrophobic suberin, presumably switching from an actively absorbing to a protective epithelium. Here, we show that suberization responds to a wide range of nutrient stresses, mediated by the stress hormones abscisic acid and ethylene. We reveal a striking ability of the root to not only regulate synthesis of suberin, but also selectively degrade it in response to ethylene. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in suberization constitute physiologically relevant, adaptive responses, pointing to a pivotal role of the endodermal membrane in nutrient homeostasis.},

The simple organization of the root of Arabidopsis thaliana allows the development of lateral root primordia to be characterized histologically. We have divided the process of lateral root development into 8 stages deﬁned by speciﬁc anatomical characteristics and cell divisions. To identify the cell types in the developing primordium we have generated a collection of marker lines that express β-glucuronidase in a tissue- or cell typespeciﬁc manner in the root. Using these tools we have constructed a model describing the lineage of each cell type in the lateral root. These studies show that organization and cell differentiation in the lateral root primordia precede the appearance of a lateral root meristem, with differential gene expression apparent after the ﬁrst set of divisions of the pericycle.},

              {INTRODUCTION}
              Cells traverse a developmental landscape as they acquire identities and progress toward end-stage differentiation. Gene regulatory networks control this progression and must be tuned according to developmental stage, cell identity, and environmental conditions. Hormones play important roles in remodeling these networks, but it has been challenging to understand how cell identities, developmental states, and hormone responses influence one another. ​​Brassinosteroids are plant steroid hormones that regulate diverse processes, including cell division and cell elongation. Brassinosteroids signal to activate {BRI}1-{EMS}-{SUPPRESSOR} 1 ({BES}1) and {BRASSINAZOLE}-{RESISTANT} 1 ({BZR}1) transcription factors, which direct gene regulatory networks to control thousands of genes. Modulating brassinosteroids can lead to different responses depending on the developmental context, but how the underlying gene regulatory networks vary in space and time is unclear.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              
                Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) is a powerful approach to investigate cell- and developmental stage–specific responses to stimuli, but most previous studies have focused on a single time point. In this work, we used time series {scRNA}-seq to delineate the gene regulatory networks controlling brassinosteroid response in the
                Arabidopsis
                root. We then confirmed the spatial and developmental models arising from single-cell analysis using tissue-specific gene manipulations.
              
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              We defined brassinosteroid-responsive gene expression using time series {scRNA}-seq. This identified the elongating root cortex as a site of brassinosteroid-mediated gene expression. Reconstruction of cortex trajectories showed that brassinosteroids promote a shift from proliferation to elongation associated with increased expression of cell wall–related genes. Accordingly, loss of brassinosteroid signaling in the cortex using a tissue-specific {CRISPR} approach impaired cell expansion in the elongation zone but had little effect on meristem cell length.
              
                To discover regulators of spatiotemporal brassinosteroid responses, we inferred gene regulatory networks across each cell type, developmental stage, and time point of our brassinosteroid time series. Our gene regulatory networks and experimental analysis revealed
                {HOMEOBOX} {FROM} {ARABIDOPSIS} {THALIANA} 7
                (
                {HAT}7
                ) and
                {GT}-2-{LIKE} 1
                (
                {GTL}1
                ) as brassinosteroid-responsive transcription factors that regulate cell elongation in the cortex. {BES}1 and {GTL}1 interact and control a common set of targets induced by brassinosteroids, as evidenced by misregulation in {scRNA}-seq of
                gtl1 df1
                mutants. These datasets represent 210,856 single-cell transcriptomes, providing a high-resolution view of brassinosteroid-mediated gene regulatory networks.
              
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              
                We have established the cortex as a site for brassinosteroid-mediated gene expression, where brassinosteroids activate cell wall–related genes and promote elongation. We further showed that
                {HAT}7
                and
                {GTL}1
                are brassinosteroid-induced regulators along cortex trajectories that control cell elongation. These findings highlight the ability of {scRNA}-seq to identify context-specific transcription factors, which could be leveraged to precisely engineer plant growth and development. Our results unveil a brassinosteroid signaling network regulating the transition from proliferation to elongation in the cortex, illuminating a spatiotemporal brassinosteroid response.

	abstract = {Brassinosteroids ({BRs}) play crucial roles in plant growth and development. Previous studies have shown that {BRs} promote cell elongation in vegetative organs in several plant species, but their contribution to meristem homeostasis remains unexplored. Our analyses report that both loss- and gain-of-function {BR}-related mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana have reduced meristem size, indicating that balanced {BR} signalling is needed for the optimal root growth. In the {BR}-insensitive bri1-116 mutant, the expression pattern of the cell division markers {CYCB}1;1, {ICK}2/{KRP}2 and {KNOLLE} revealed that a decreased mitotic activity accounts for the reduced meristem size; accordingly, this defect could be overcome by the overexpression of {CYCD}3;1. The activity of the quiescent centre ({QC}) was low in the short roots of bri1-116, as reported by cell type-specific markers and differentiation phenotypes of distal stem cells. Conversely, plants treated with the most active {BR}, brassinolide, or mutants with enhanced {BR} signalling, such as bes1-D, show a premature cell cycle exit that results in early differentiation of meristematic cells, which also negatively influence meristem size and overall root growth. In the stem cell niche, {BRs} promote the {QC} renewal and differentiation of distal stem cells. Together, our results provide evidence that {BRs} play a regulatory role in the control of cell-cycle progression and differentiation in the Arabidopsis root meristem.},

              In

This includes loss of cell volume whilst maintaining membrane integrity to allow the expansion of the underlying {LR} primordia ({LRPs}). These accommodation responses are regulated by auxin‐mediated signaling, specifically through Aux/{IAA} proteins, involving

Using treatments with auxins having different transport properties, such as {NAA}, indole‐3‐acetic acid ({IAA}), and 2,4‐dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4‐D), we assessed the ability of each auxin to rescue {LR} formation in

              It's tough to drive a spade through compacted soil, and plant roots seem to have the same problem when growing in compacted ground. Pandey
              et al.
              found that the problem is not, however, one of physical resistance but rather inhibition of growth through a signaling pathway. The volatile plant hormone ethylene will diffuse through aerated soil, but compacted soil reduces such diffusion, increasing the concentration of ethylene near root tissues. The cellular signaling cascades triggered by too much ethylene stop root growth. Therefore, gaseous diffusion serves as a readout of soil compaction for plant roots growing in search of productive nutrition.

          , 
            
              Soil compaction represents a major challenge for modern agriculture. Compaction is intuitively thought to reduce root growth by limiting the ability of roots to penetrate harder soils. We report that root growth in compacted soil is instead actively suppressed by the volatile hormone ethylene. We found that mutant
              Arabidopsis
              and rice roots that were insensitive to ethylene penetrated compacted soil more effectively than did wild-type roots. Our results indicate that soil compaction lowers gas diffusion through a reduction in air-filled pores, thereby causing ethylene to accumulate in root tissues and trigger hormone responses that restrict growth. We propose that ethylene acts as an early warning signal for roots to avoid compacted soils, which would be relevant to research into the breeding of crops resilient to soil compaction.},

When lateral roots were induced from explants of very young seedlings of these mutants by culture with exogenously supplied auxin at 28°C, expansion of lateral root primordia leading to lateral root fasciation occurred reproducibly and semi-synchronously with a high frequency. This experimental system allowed us to examine how radial organization of root tissues is altered in association with expansion of primordia. Analysis with various tissue-speciﬁc reporter genes indicated that in the fasciated lateral roots, cell ﬁles of the stele are increased markedly while the numbers of cortical and epidermal cell layers are not changed. This suggests that radial organization during root primordium development involves a mechanism that makes outer layer patterning more robust than inner layer patterning against unusual enlargement of the morphogenetic ﬁeld.},

This differential expression pattern is regulated by posttranslational modification of {ARF}7 with the small ubiquitin-like modifier ({SUMO}) protein. {SUMOylation} negatively regulates {ARF}7 {DNA} binding activity. {ARF}7 {SUMOylation} is required to recruit the Aux/{IAA} (indole-3-acetic acid) repressor protein {IAA}3. Blocking {ARF}7 {SUMOylation} disrupts {IAA}3 recruitment and hydropatterning.

              {INTRODUCTION}
              Plants continuously adjust their body plans to adapt to the local environment by forming new organs in different developmental contexts. Underground, lateral roots initiate from designated cells in the pericycle of the main root. Aboveground, plants generate shoot-borne roots, bypassing the embryonic root-shoot lineage separation. Shoot-borne roots commonly form in response to stimuli such as flooding or wounding, but many plants also initiate these roots as part of their normal development. Indeed, fossil record evidence suggests that growth by shoot-bearing roots is an ancestral trait of flowering plants (angiosperms). However, the ontogeny of shoot-borne roots and its relationship to the initiation of lateral and wound-induced roots are unclear.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              
                Tomato (
                Solanum lycopersicum
                ) is a vine that readily generates many roots from its stem as part of its normal development, making it an attractive model system with which to study shoot-borne root initiation. Here, we characterized the ontogeny of tomato shoot-borne roots at single-cell resolution. We used these data to identify a key regulator of shoot-borne root initiation and applied genetic and molecular characterization to multiple angiosperm species to test the functional and regulatory conservation of shoot-borne and lateral root initiation programs.
              
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              To identify the origin of shoot-borne roots, we generated tomatoes carrying fluorescent reporters for early root initiation transcriptional responses. Using these, we show that tomato shoot-borne roots initiate from a small population of primary phloem–associated cells. We isolated these rare cells for single-cell {mRNA}-sequencing profiling, along with three other time points of shoot-borne root development. This analysis uncovered the existence of a transition state unique to the earliest stage of root meristem initiation. Trajectory reconstruction indicated that cells in this state were the progenitors of the new root stem cells and cap tissues.
              
                The transition state was characterized by the expression of a
                {LATERAL} {ORGAN} {BOUNDARIES} {DOMAIN}
                (
                {LBD}
                ) transcription factor that we named
                {SHOOT} {BORNE} {ROOTLESS}
                (
                {SBRL}
                ) because loss of function of this gene resulted in plants lacking shoot-borne roots. High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the
                {SBRL}
                family revealed that it belongs to an angiosperm-specific gene clade (subclass {IIIB}). We show that members of this clade had shoot-borne root–specific expression or function in multiple species (potato,
                Arabidopsis
                , sweet potato, white beans, and sorghum). Further, previously identified regulators of shoot-borne root initiation in maize and rice were also classified as subclass {IIIB} genes, indicating that the shoot-borne root–specific function of this gene is deeply conserved.
              
              Comparative genomics identified that subclass {IIIB} genes are part of a conserved superlocus containing genes of the sister clade, subclass {IIIA}. Although subclass {IIIA} genes did not play a role in shoot-borne root initiation, we show that they control the initiation of underground lateral roots in multiple plant species. Similar to the function of subclass {IIIB} in shoot-borne roots, the expression of subclass {IIIA} genes was transient and correlated with the expression of transition state markers, suggesting a common mechanism for root meristem initiation.
              
                Apart from naturally occurring shoot-borne roots, plants also form wound-induced roots. Genetic analysis identified at least two classes of these roots: The first is derived from stems and regulated by the subclass {IIIB} gene
                {SBRL}
                , and the second is derived from hypocotyl wound tissue and regulated by a subclass {IIIA} gene.
              
              
                The conserved root-type-specific function of subclass {IIIA} and {IIIB} genes suggested that their regulatory program may be ancient. Indeed, the superlocus had a high level of noncoding sequence conservation, and tomato regulatory sequences were sufficient to drive transient shoot-borne- and lateral-root-specific expression even when used in the distant
                Arabidopsis
                .
              
              Finally, to test whether this family regulates the initiation of all root types, we generated a tomato loss-of-function mutant for all three subclass {IIIA}/{IIIB} genes found in this species. These triple mutants lacked shoot-borne, lateral, and wound-induced roots, producing only a single barren embryonic root.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              We conclude that root meristem formation initiates through a common transition state associated with deeply conserved subclass {IIIA} and {IIIB} genes. These genes control the initiation of different root types, with subclass {IIIB} playing a nonredundant role in shoot-borne root initiation and subclass {IIIA} acting in the initiation of lateral and some wound-induced roots. The appearance of a superlocus of subclass {IIIA} and {IIIB} genes in early angiosperm allowed specialization in the genetic regulation of different root types, enabling the plant’s complex developmental response to varied environments.
              
                
                  Conserved regulation of root initiation.
                  The initiation of tomato shoot-borne and lateral roots varies in developmental and hormonal dynamics. However, single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-Seq) of shoot-borne roots revealed that they share a common transition state. An angiosperm-specific superlocus of transition-state-expressed genes governs root initiation, with the two superlocus members (subclass {IIIA} and {IIIB} genes) having conserved root-type-specific activity.

	abstract = {The hormone auxin plays a crucial role in plant morphogenesis. In the shoot apical meristem, the {PIN}-{FORMED}1 ({PIN}1) efflux carrier concentrates auxin into local maxima in the epidermis, which position incipient leaf or floral primordia. From these maxima, {PIN}1 transports auxin into internal tissues along emergent paths that pattern leaf and stem vasculature. In Arabidopsis thaliana, these functions are attributed to a single {PIN}1 protein. Using phylogenetic and gene synteny analysis we identified an angiosperm {PIN} clade sister to {PIN}1, here termed Sister-of-{PIN}1 ({SoPIN}1), which is present in all sampled angiosperms except for Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis. Additionally, we identified a conserved duplication of {PIN}1 in the grasses: {PIN}1a and {PIN}1b. In Brachypodium distachyon, {SoPIN}1 is highly expressed in the epidermis and is consistently polarized toward regions of high expression of the {DR}5 auxin-signaling reporter, which suggests that {SoPIN}1 functions in the localization of new primordia. In contrast, {PIN}1a and {PIN}1b are highly expressed in internal tissues, suggesting a role in vascular patterning. {PIN}1b is expressed in broad regions spanning the space between new primordia and previously formed vasculature, suggesting a role in connecting new organs to auxin sinks in the older tissues. Within these regions, {PIN}1a forms narrow canals that likely pattern future veins. Using a computer model, we reproduced the observed spatio-temporal expression and localization patterns of these proteins by assuming that {SoPIN}1 is polarized up the auxin gradient, and {PIN}1a and {PIN}1b are polarized to different degrees with the auxin flux. Our results suggest that examination and modeling of {PIN} dynamics in plants outside of Brassicaceae will offer insights into auxin-driven patterning obscured by the loss of the {SoPIN}1 clade in Brassicaceae.},

Each phase of this developmental process in Arabidopsis is tightly regulated by dynamic and continuous signalling of the phytohormones cytokinin and auxin. While the roles of auxin in lateral root organogenesis and spatial accommodation by overlying cell layers have been well studied, insights on the importance of cytokinin is still somewhat limited. Cytokinin is a negative regulator of lateral root formation with versatile modes of action being activated at different root developmental zones. Here, we review the latest progress made towards our understanding of these spatially separated mechanisms of cytokinin-mediated signalling that shape lateral root initiation, outgrowth and emergence and highlight some of the enticing open questions.},

Here, we show that {LRX}8-{RALF}4 complexes adopt a heterotetrametric configuration in vivo, displaying a dendritic distribution. The {LRX}8-{RALF}4 complex specifically interacts with demethylesterified pectins in a charge-dependent manner through {RALF}4’s polycationic surface. The {LRX}8-{RALF}4-pectin interaction exerts a condensing effect, patterning the cell wall’s polymers into a reticulated network essential for wall integrity and expansion. Our work uncovers a dual structural and signaling role for {RALF}4 in pollen tube growth and in the assembly of complex extracellular polymers.

            Editor’s summary
            
              Plant cells are surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall that withstands internal cellular pressure but adapts and restructures as the cell expands. In growing pollen tubes, the proteins {RALF}4 and {LRX}8 are required to monitor integrity of the cell wall. Moussu
              et al
              . demonstrated that these proteins form a complex with pectic polysaccharides, the gel-like component of the cell wall (see the Perspective by Mohnen). In addition to the roles of {RALF}4 and {LRX}8 in signaling to the intracellular environment, the protein-polysaccharide complex performs a structural role in patterning the cell wall. This work contributes to our understanding of how signaling proteins can react to changes in the physical state of the extracellular structure. —Madeleine Seale

Here, we analyzed the role of the B1 subclass of mitotic cyclins in cell cycle control during Arabidopsis development. While we reveal {CYCB}1;5 to be a pseudogene, the remaining four members were found to be expressed in dividing cells. Mutant analyses showed a complex pattern of overlapping, developmentspecific requirements of B1-type cyclins with {CYCB}1;2 playing a central role. The double mutant cycb1;1 cycb1;2 is severely compromised in growth, yet viable beyond the seedling stage, hence representing a unique opportunity to study the function of B1-type cyclin activity at the organismic level. Immunolocalization of microtubules in cycb1;1 cycb1;2 and treating mutants with the microtubule drug oryzalin revealed a key role of B1-type cyclins in orchestrating mitotic microtubule networks. Subsequently, we identified the {GAMMA}-{TUBULIN} {COMPLEX} {PROTEIN} 3INTERACTING {PROTEIN} 1 ({GIP}1/{MOZART}) as an in vitro substrate of B1-type cyclin complexes and further genetic analyses support a potential role in the regulation of {GIP}1 by {CYCB}1s.},

The colonization of the soil requires investment of carbon and energy, but how sugar and energy signaling are integrated with root branching is unknown. Here, we show through combined genetic and chemical modulation of signaling pathways that the sugar small-molecule signal, trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) regulates root branching through master kinases {SNF}1-related kinase-1 ({SnRK}1) and Target of Rapamycin ({TOR}) and with the involvement of the plant hormone auxin. Increase of T6P levels both via genetic targeting in lateral root ({LR}) founder cells and through light-activated release of the presignaling T6P-precursor reveals that T6P increases root branching through coordinated inhibition of {SnRK}1 and activation of {TOR}. Auxin, the master regulator of {LR} formation, impacts this T6P function by transcriptionally down-regulating the T6P-degrader trehalose phosphate phosphatase B in {LR} cells. Our results reveal a regulatory energy-balance network for {LR} formation that links the ‘sugar signal’ T6P to both {SnRK}1 and {TOR} downstream of auxin.},

	abstract = {Cell production and differentiation for the acquisition of specific functions are key features of living systems. The dynamic network of cellular microtubules provides the necessary platform to accommodate processes associated with the transition of cells through the individual phases of cytogenesis. Here, we show that the plant hormone cytokinin fine-tunes the activity of the microtubular cytoskeleton during cell differentiation and counteracts microtubular rearrangements driven by the hormone auxin. The endogenous upward gradient of cytokinin activity along the longitudinal growth axis in Arabidopsis thaliana roots correlates with robust rearrangements of the microtubule cytoskeleton in epidermal cells progressing from the proliferative to the differentiation stage. Controlled increases in cytokinin activity result in premature reorganization of the microtubule network from transversal to an oblique disposition in cells prior to their differentiation, whereas attenuated hormone perception delays cytoskeleton conversion into a configuration typical for differentiated cells. Intriguingly, cytokinin can interfere with microtubules also in animal cells, such as leukocytes, suggesting that a cytokinin-sensitive control pathway for the microtubular cytoskeleton may be at least partially conserved between plant and animal cells.},

In addition to estimating developmental progressions in pseudotime, we employed the mathematical concept of optimal transport to infer developmental trajectories and identify their underlying regulators. To demonstrate the utility of the atlas to interpret new datasets, we proﬁled mutants for two key transcriptional regulators at single-cell resolution, shortroot and scarecrow.

By combining the application of mechanical stress with high-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that the cuticle buckles to create a striated pattern.

Brassinosteroid ({BR}) hormones regulate pavement cell morphogenesis, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

The phgap1phgap2 mutant displayed severe epidermal cell shape phenotypes, and the {PHGAPs} were markedly enriched in the anticlinal face of the pavement cell indenting regions. {BIN}2 phosphorylation of {PHGAPs} was required for their stability and polarization. {BIN}2 inhibition activated {ROP}2-{GTPase} signaling speciﬁcally in the lobes because of {PHGAP} degradation, while the {PHGAPs} restrained {ROP}2 activity in the indentations. Hence, we connect {BR} and {ROP}2-{GTPase} signaling pathways via the regulation of {PHGAPs} and put forward the importance of spatiotemporal control of {BR} signaling for pavement cell interdigitation.},

Two unrelated microtubule-binding proteins, {TANGLED}1 ({TAN}1) and {AUXIN}-{INDUCED} {IN} {ROOT} {CULTURES}9 ({AIR}9), are together required for normal growth and division plane orientation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The tan1 air9 double mutant has synthetic growth and division plane orientation defects, while single mutants lack obvious defects. Here we show that the division sitelocalized protein, {PHRAGMOPLAST} {ORIENTING} {KINESIN}1 ({POK}1), was aberrantly lost from the division site during metaphase and telophase in the tan1 air9 mutant. Since {TAN}1 and {POK}1 interact via the ﬁrst 132 amino acids of {TAN}1 ({TAN}11–132), we assessed the localization and function of {TAN}11–132 in the tan1 air9 double mutant. {TAN}11–132 rescued tan1 air9 mutant phenotypes and localized to the division site during telophase. However, replacing six amino-acid residues within {TAN}11–132, which disrupted the {POK}1–{TAN}1 interaction in the yeast-two-hybrid system, caused loss of both rescue and division site localization of {TAN}11–132 in the tan1 air9 mutant. Full-length {TAN}1 with the same alanine substitutions had defects in phragmoplast guidance and reduced {TAN}1 and {POK}1 localization at the division site but rescued most tan1 air9 mutant phenotypes. Together, these data suggest that {TAN}1 and {AIR}9 are required for {POK}1 localization, and yet unknown proteins may stabilize {TAN}1–{POK}1 interactions.},

	abstract = {Although the formation of new walls during plant cell division tends to follow maximal tensile stress direction, analyses of individual cells over time reveal a much more variable behavior. The origin of such variability as well as the exact role of interphasic microtubule behavior before cell division have remained mysterious so far. To approach this question, we took advantage of the
              Arabidopsis
              stem, where the tensile stress pattern is both highly anisotropic and stable. Although cortical microtubules ({CMTs}) generally align with maximal tensile stress, we detected a specific time window, ca. 3 h before cell division, where cells form a radial pattern of {CMTs}. This microtubule array organization preceded preprophase band ({PPB}) formation, a transient {CMT} array predicting the position of the future division plane. It was observed under different growth conditions and was not related to cell geometry or polar auxin transport. Interestingly, this cortical radial pattern correlated with the well-documented increase of cytoplasmic microtubule accumulation before cell division. This radial organization was prolonged in cells of the
              trm678
              mutant, where {CMTs} are unable to form a {PPB}. Whereas division plane orientation in
              trm678
              is noisier, we found that cell division symmetry was in contrast less variable between daughter cells. We propose that this “radial step” reflects a trade-off in robustness for two essential cell division attributes: symmetry and orientation. This involves a “reset” stage in G2, where an increased cytoplasmic microtubule accumulation transiently disrupts {CMT} alignment with tissue stress.},

However, the complicated operational protocols and low efﬁciency of current transformation strategies restrict the genetic modiﬁcation of most plant species. This paper describes the development of the regenerative activity–dependent in planta injection delivery ({RAPID}) method based on the active regeneration capacity of plants. In this method, Agrobacterium tumefaciens is delivered to plant meristems via injection to induce transfected nascent tissues. Stable transgenic plants can be obtained by subsequent vegetative propagation of the positive nascent tissues. The method was successfully used for transformation of plants with strong regeneration capacity, including different genotypes of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and bayhops (Ipomoea pes-caprae). Compared with traditional transformation methods, {RAPID} has a much higher transformation efﬁciency and shorter duration, and it does not require tissue culture procedures. The {RAPID} method therefore overcomes the limitations of traditional methods to enable rapid in planta transformation and can be potentially applied to a wide range of plant species that are capable of active regeneration.},

	abstract = {Plant roots exhibit plasticity in their branching patterns to forage efficiently for heterogeneously distributed resources, such as soil water. The xerobranching response represses lateral root formation when roots lose contact with water. Here, we show that xerobranching is regulated by radial movement of the phloem-derived hormone abscisic acid, which disrupts intercellular communication between inner and outer cell layers through plasmodesmata. Closure of these intercellular pores disrupts the inward movement of the hormone signal auxin, blocking lateral root branching. Once root tips regain contact with moisture, the abscisic acid response rapidly attenuates. Our study reveals how roots adapt their branching pattern to heterogeneous soil water conditions by linking changes in hydraulic flux with dynamic hormone redistribution.

              Plant roots are most effective in pockets of soil containing the water that the plant needs. Water is not uniformly distributed throughout the soil, and the xerobranching response, in which lateral root formation is suppressed, ensures that roots are not uniformly distributed either. Mehra

In moist conditions, water flows from the root surface into the phloem, but in a dry spot, water flows instead from the phloem out into the root tissues. This reverse flow carries along the phloem-derived hormone abscisic acid, which closes off intercellular pores, blocking the ability of the hormone auxin to initiate lateral root development. —{PJH}

Leaf epidermis contains jigsaw puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells whose shape has been proposed to be a result of subcellular variations in expansion rate that induce local buckling events. Paradoxically, such local compressive buckling should not occur given the tensile stresses across the epidermis. Using computational modeling, we show that the simplest scenario to explain pavement cell shapes within an epidermis under tension must involve mechanical wall heterogeneities across and along the anticlinal pavement cell walls between adjacent cells. Combining genetics, atomic force microscopy, and immunolabeling, we demonstrate that contiguous cell walls indeed exhibit hybrid mechanochemical properties. Such biochemical wall heterogeneities precede wall bending. Altogether, this provides a possible mechanism for the generation of complex plant cell shapes.},

            {AUXIN} {RESISTANCE}4 ({AXR}4) regulates the trafficking of auxin influx carrier {AUXIN}1 ({AUX}1), a plasma-membrane protein that predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}) in the absence of {AXR}4. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), {AUX}1 is a member of a small multigene family comprising 4 highly conserved genes—{AUX}1, {LIKE}-{AUX}1 ({LAX}1), {LAX}2, and {LAX}3. We report here that {LAX}2 also requires {AXR}4 for correct localization to the plasma membrane. {AXR}4 is a plant-specific protein and contains a weakly conserved α/β hydrolase fold domain that is found in several classes of lipid hydrolases and transferases. We have previously proposed that {AXR}4 may either act as (i) a post-translational modifying enzyme through its α/β hydrolase fold domain or (ii) an {ER} accessory protein, which is a special class of {ER} protein that regulates targeting of their cognate partner proteins. Here, we show that {AXR}4 is unlikely to act as a post-translational modifying enzyme as mutations in several highly conserved amino acids in the α/β hydrolase fold domain can be tolerated and active site residues are missing. We also show that {AUX}1 and {AXR}4 physically interact with each other and that {AXR}4 reduces aggregation of {AUX}1 in a dose-dependent fashion. Our results suggest that {AXR}4 acts as an {ER} accessory protein. A better understanding of {AXR}4-mediated trafficking of auxin transporters in crop plants will be crucial for improving root traits (designer roots) for better acquisition of water and nutrients for sustainable and resilient agriculture.},

The root pericycle represents a unique tissue with conditional meristematic activity, and its tight control determines initiation of lateral organs. Here we show that the meristematic activity of the pericycle is constrained by the interaction with the adjacent endodermis. Release of these restraints by elimination of endodermal cells by single-cell ablation triggers the pericycle to re-enter the cell cycle. We found that endodermis removal substitutes for the phytohormone auxin-dependent initiation of the pericycle meristematic activity. However, auxin is indispensable to steer the cell division plane orientation of new organ-defining divisions. We propose a dual, spatiotemporally distinct role for auxin during lateral root initiation. In the endodermis, auxin releases constraints arising from cell-to-cell interactions that compromise the pericycle meristematic activity, whereas, in the pericycle, auxin defines the orientation of the cell division plane to initiate lateral roots.},

	title = {Regulation and Function of a Polarly Localized Lignin Barrier in the Exodermis},
	abstract = {Multicellular organisms control interactions with their environment through the development of specialized barriers in specific cell types. A conserved barrier in plant roots is the endodermal Casparian strip ({CS}). The {CS} is made of polymerized lignin and forms a ring-like structure that seals the apoplastic space between the endodermal cells. Most angiosperms also have another root cell type, the exodermis, that is reported to form a barrier. Our understanding of exodermal developmental and molecular regulation, as well as function, is limited as this cell type is absent from the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) as a model system we demonstrate that in this species, the exodermis does not form a {CS}. Instead, it forms a polar lignin cap with an equivalent barrier function to the endodermal {CS}. We demonstrate that although endodermal regulators are conserved between Arabidopsis and tomato, exodermal differentiation occurs by a distinct regulatory pathway involving the {SlSCZ} and {SlEXO}1 transcription factors. Although the exodermis and endodermis both produce barriers that restrict mineral ion uptake, they have unique and overlapping roles in their selectivity. Whether conservation and similarities between the endodermis and exodermis exist in other species remains to be determined. Nonetheless, in tomato, these distinct lignin structures have a convergent function with different genetic regulations.},

	abstract = {Endoreplication is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for increasing nuclear {DNA} content (ploidy). Ploidy frequently scales with final cell and organ size, suggesting a key role for endoreplication in these processes. However, exceptions exist, and, consequently, the endoreplication-size nexus remains enigmatic. Here, we show that prolonged tissue folding at the apical hook in Arabidopsis requires endoreplication asymmetry under the control of an auxin gradient. We identify a molecular pathway linking endoreplication levels to cell size through cell wall remodeling and stiffness modulation. We find that endoreplication is not only permissive for growth: Endoreplication reduction enhances wall stiffening, actively reducing cell size. The cell wall integrity kinase {THESEUS} plays a key role in this feedback loop. Our data thus explain the nonlinearity between ploidy levels and size while also providing a molecular mechanism linking mechanochemical signaling with endoreplication-mediated dynamic control of cell growth.

	abstract = {The growing world population increases demand for agricultural production, which is more challenging as climate change increases global temperature and causes more extreme weather events. High-throughput phenotyping tools can be used to measure plant responses to the environment to identify genomic regions associated with response to stress. This study examines the phenotypic variation of 149 accessions of Brachypodium distachyon under drought, heat, and the combination of both stresses. Heat alone causes the largest amounts of tissue damage and the combination of heat and drought causes the largest decrease in plant biomass compared to other treatments. Notably, Bd21-0, the reference line for B. distachyon, was identified as not having very robust growth under stress conditions, especially in the heat-drought combined treatment. Climate data from the collection locations of these accessions (climate of origin) was used to assess whether climate of origin was correlated with responses to stresses and it was found to be significantly associated with height and percent of plant tissue damage. Additionally, genome wide association mapping found a number of genetic loci associated with changes in plant height, biomass, and the amount of damaged tissue under stress. Some {SNPs} found to be significantly associated with a response to heat or drought are also significantly associated in the combination of stresses, while others are not, and some significantly associated {SNPs} were only identified in the combined stress treatment. This, combined with the phenotypic data, indicates that the effects of these abiotic stresses are not simply additive, and the responses of B. distachyon to the combined stresses differ from drought and heat alone.

	abstract = {Significance
            Carotenoids are natural pigments whose properties as provitamin A and health-promoting phytonutrients make them ideal targets for biofortification. Here, we show that plastids specialized in carotenoid overaccumulation named chromoplasts can be synthetically produced in plant tissues that do not naturally develop them. We further demonstrate that differentiation of chromoplasts from leaf chloroplasts not just causes but requires both a reduction in photosynthetic activity and a stimulation of carotenoid biosynthesis in a process hardwired to a major reprogramming of global gene expression and cell metabolism. The synthetic system that we report here should allow to boost the nutritional quality of green vegetables and forage crops once their photosynthetic activity is dispensable (e.g., just before harvesting).
          , 
            Plastids, the defining organelles of plant cells, undergo physiological and morphological changes to fulfill distinct biological functions. In particular, the differentiation of chloroplasts into chromoplasts results in an enhanced storage capacity for carotenoids with industrial and nutritional value such as beta-carotene (provitamin A). Here, we show that synthetically inducing a burst in the production of phytoene, the first committed intermediate of the carotenoid pathway, elicits an artificial chloroplast-to-chromoplast differentiation in leaves. Phytoene overproduction initially interferes with photosynthesis, acting as a metabolic threshold switch mechanism that weakens chloroplast identity. In a second stage, phytoene conversion into downstream carotenoids is required for the differentiation of chromoplasts, a process that involves a concurrent reprogramming of nuclear gene expression and plastid morphology for improved carotenoid storage. We hence demonstrate that loss of photosynthetic competence and enhanced production of carotenoids are not just consequences but requirements for chloroplasts to differentiate into chromoplasts.},

Formin-dependent actin polymerization plays vital roles in vesicle trafﬁcking and polarity establishment during this process. However, how formin-mediated actin assembly is regulated in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the function of reproductive proﬁlin 4 and 5 ({PRF}4 and {PRF}5) in polarity establishment during pollen germination in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our data showed that the actin ﬁlament content was reduced in the prf4 prf5 double mutant and substantially increased in both {PRF}4- and {PRF}5-overexpressing pollen grains. By contrast, the positive effect of proﬁlin in promoting actin polymerization was abolished in a formin mutant, atfh5. In addition, the interaction between Arabidopsis formin homology 5 ({AtFH}5) and actin ﬁlaments was attenuated and the trafﬁcking of {AtFH}5-labeled vesicles was slowed in prf4 prf5 pollen grains. Formation of the collar-like structure at the germination pore was also defective in prf4 prf5 pollen grains as the fast assembly of actin ﬁlaments was impaired. Together, our results suggest that {PRF}4 and {PRF}5 regulate vesicle trafﬁcking and polarity establishment during pollen germination by promoting {AtFH}5-mediated actin polymerization and enhancing the interaction between {AtFH}5 and actin ﬁlaments.},

            Normally, when different species of herbivorous arthropods feed on the same plant this leads to fitness-reducing competition. We found this to be different for two of Asia’s most destructive rice pests, the brown planthopper and the rice striped stem borer. Both insects directly and indirectly benefit from jointly attacking the same host plant. Double infestation improved host plant quality, particularly for the stemborer because the planthopper fully suppresses caterpillar-induced production of proteinase inhibitors. It also reduced the risk of egg parasitism, due to diminished parasitoid attraction. Females of both pests have adapted their oviposition behaviour accordingly. Their strong preference for plants infested by the other species even overrides their avoidance of plants already attacked by conspecifics. This cooperation between herbivores is telling of adaptations resulting from the evolution of plant-insect interactions, and points out mechanistic vulnerabilities that can be targeted to control these major pests.},

            Thousands of long intergenic noncoding {RNAs} ({lincRNAs}) have been identified in plant genomes. While some {lincRNAs} have been characterized as important regulators in different biological processes, little is known about the transcriptional regulation for most plant {lincRNAs}. Through the integration of eight annotation resources, we defined 6,599 high-confidence {lincRNA} loci in
            Arabidopsis thaliana
            . For {lincRNAs} belonging to different evolutionary age categories, we identified major differences in sequence and chromatin features, as well as in the level of conservation and purifying selection acting during evolution. Spatiotemporal gene expression profiles combined with transcription factor ({TF}) chromatin immunoprecipitation data were used to construct a {TF}- {lincRNA} regulatory network containing 2,659 {lincRNAs} and 15,686 interactions. We found that properties characterizing {lincRNA} expression, conservation and regulation differ between plants and animals. Experimental validation confirmed the role of three {TFs}, {KAN}1, {MYB}44, and {PIF}4, as key regulators controlling root- specific {lincRNA} expression, demonstrating the predictive power of our network. Furthermore, we identified 58 {lincRNAs}, regulated by these {TFs}, showing strong root cell-type specific expression or chromatin accessibility, which are linked with {GWAS} genetic associations related to root system development and growth. The multi-level genome-wide characterization covering chromatin state information, promoter conservation, and {ChIP}-based {TF} binding, for all detectable {lincRNAs} across 769 expression samples, permits to rapidly define the biological context and relevance of {lincRNAs} in Arabidopsis regulatory networks.

	abstract = {The explosive growth of single-molecule techniques is transforming our understanding of biology, helping to develop new physics inspired by emergent biological processes, and leading to emerging areas of nanotechnology. Key biological and chemical processes can now be probed with new levels of detail, one molecule at a time, from the nanoscopic dynamics of nature’s molecular machines to an ever-expanding range of exciting applications across multiple length and time scales. Their common feature is an ability to render the underlying distribution of molecular properties that ensemble averaging masks and to reveal new insights into complex systems containing spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Small ﬂuorescent probes are among the most adaptable and versatile for single-molecule sensing applications because they provide high signalto-noise ratios combined with excellent speciﬁcity of labeling when chemically attached to target biomolecules or embedded within a host material. In this review, we examine recent advances in probe designs, their utility, and applications and provide a practical guide to their use, focusing on the single-molecule detection of nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and membrane dynamics. We also present key challenges that must be overcome to perform successful single-molecule experiments, including probe conjugation strategies, identify tradeoffs and limitations for each probe design, showcase emerging applications, and discuss exciting future directions for the community.},

Traditionally it is based on a multitude of type {II} restriction endonucleases and T4 {DNA} ligase. Especially in case of long inserts and applications requiring high-throughput, this approach is limited by the number of available unique restriction sites and the need for designing individual cloning strategies for each project. Several alternative cloning systems have been developed in recent years to overcome these issues, including the type {IIS} enzyme based Golden Gate technique. Here we introduce our {GreenGate} system for rapidly assembling plant transformation constructs, which is based on the Golden Gate method. {GreenGate} cloning is simple and efficient since it uses only one type {IIS} restriction endonuclease, depends on only six types of insert modules (plant promoter, N-terminal tag, coding sequence, C-terminal tag, plant terminator and plant resistance cassette), but at the same time allows assembling several expression cassettes in one binary destination vector from a collection of pre-cloned building blocks. The system is cheap and reliable and when combined with a library of modules considerably speeds up cloning and transgene stacking for plant transformation.},

          , 
            Glycans are involved in numerous biological recognition events. Being secondary gene products, their labeling by genetic methods – comparable to {GFP} labeling of proteins – is not possible. To overcome this limitation, metabolic glycoengineering ({MGE}, also known as metabolic oligosaccharide engineering, {MOE}) has been developed. In this approach, cells or organisms are treated with synthetic carbohydrate derivatives that are modified with a chemical reporter group. In the cytosol, the compounds are metabolized and incorporated into newly synthesized glycoconjugates. Subsequently, the reporter groups can be further derivatized in a bioorthogonal ligation reaction. In this way, glycans can be visualized or isolated. Furthermore, diverse targeting strategies have been developed to direct drugs, nanoparticles, or whole cells to a desired location. This review summarizes research in the field of {MGE} carried out in recent years. After an introduction to the bioorthogonal ligation reactions that have been used in in connection with {MGE}, an overview on carbohydrate derivatives for {MGE} is given. The last part of the review focuses on the many applications of {MGE} starting from mammalian cells to experiments with animals and other organisms.},

By tryptic peptide mass ﬁngerprinting we identiﬁed 55 proteins that were enriched on taxol-microtubules. Amongst a range of known {MAPs}, such as kinesins, {MAP}65 isoforms and {MOR}1, we detected ‘unknown’ 70 {kDa} proteins that belong to a family of ﬁve closely related Arabidopsis proteins having no known homologues amongst non-plant organisms.

This conﬁrmed that the protein decorates all four microtubule arrays in both transiently infected Arabidopsis and stably transformed tobacco {BY}-2 suspension cells. Microtubule-directed drugs perturbed the localization of {AtMAP}70-1 but cytochalasin D did not. {AtMAP}70-1 contains four predicted coiledcoil domains and truncation studies identiﬁed a central domain that targets the fusion protein to microtubules in vivo.

The overexpressed fusion protein perturbs cell polarity in cell suspensions by inducing extra poles for growth.

            The plant cytokinetic microtubule array, called the phragmoplast, exhibits higher microtubule dynamics in its center (midzone) than at the periphery (distal zone). This behavior is known as the axial asymmetry. Despite being a major characteristic of the phragmoplast, little is known about regulators of this phenomenon. Here we address the role of microtubule nucleation in axial asymmetry by characterizing {MACERATOR} ({MACET}) proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana with a combination of genetic, biochemical, and live-cell imaging assays, using photo-convertible microtubule probes, and modeling. {MACET} paralogs accumulate at the shrinking microtubule ends and decrease the tubulin {OFF} rate. Loss of {MACET}4 and {MACET}5 function abrogates axial asymmetry by suppressing microtubule dynamicity in the midzone. {MACET}4 also narrows the microtubule nucleation angle at the phragmoplast leading edge and functions as a microtubule tethering factor for {AUGMIN} {COMPLEX} {SUBUNIT} 7 ({AUG}7). The macet4 macet5 double mutant shows diminished clustering of {AUG}7 in the phragmoplast distal zone. Knockout of {AUG}7 does not affect {MACET}4 localization, axial asymmetry, or microtubule nucleation angle, but increases phragmoplast length and slows down phragmoplast expansion. The mce4-1 mce5 aug7-1 triple knockout is not viable. Experimental data and modeling demonstrate that microtubule nucleation factors regulate phragmoplast architecture and axial asymmetry directly by generating new microtubules and indirectly by modulating the abundance of free tubulin.},

            Tight control of lateral root ({LR}) initiation is vital for root system architecture and function. Regulation of cortical microtubule reorganization is involved in the asymmetric radial expansion of founder cells during {LR} initiation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, critical genetic evidence on the role of microtubules in {LR} initiation is lacking and the mechanisms underlying this regulation are poorly understood. Here, we found that the previously uncharacterized microtubule-stabilizing protein {TPX}2-{LIKE}5 ({TPXL}5) participates in {LR} initiation, which is finely regulated by the transcription factor {ELONGATED} {HYPOCOTYL}5 ({HY}5). In tpxl5 mutants, {LR} density was decreased and more {LR} primordia ({LRPs}) remained in stage I, indicating delayed {LR} initiation. In particular, the cell width in the peripheral domain of {LR} founder cells after the first asymmetric cell division was larger in tpxl5 mutants than in the wild-type. Consistently, ordered transverse cortical microtubule arrays were not well generated in tpxl5 mutants. In addition, {HY}5 directly targeted the promoter of {TPXL}5 and downregulated {TPXL}5 expression. The hy5 mutant exhibited higher {LR} density and fewer stage I {LRPs}, indicating accelerated {LR} initiation. Such phenotypes were partially suppressed by {TPXL}5 knockout. Taken together, our data provide genetic evidence supporting the notion that cortical microtubules are essential for {LR} initiation and unravel a molecular mechanism underlying {HY}5 regulation of {TPXL}5-mediated microtubule reorganization and cell remodeling during {LR} initiation.},

	abstract = {Morphogenesis in plants depends critically on directional (anisotropic) growth. This occurs principally perpendicular to the net orientation of cellulose microfibrils ({CMFs}), which is in turn controlled by cortical microtubules ({CMTs}). In young lateral roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, growth anisotropy also depends on {RAB}-A5c, a plant-specific small {GTPase} that specifies a membrane trafficking pathway to the geometric edges of cells. Here we investigate the functional relationship between structural anisotropy at faces and {RAB}-A5c activity at edges during lateral root development. We show that surprisingly, inhibition of {RAB}-A5c function is associated with increased {CMT}/{CMF} anisotropy. We present genetic, pharmacological, and modelling evidence that this increase in {CMT}/{CMF} anisotropy partially compensates for loss of an independent {RAB}-A5c-mediated mechanism that maintains anisotropic growth in meristematic cells. We show that {RAB}-A5c associates with {CMTs} at cell edges, indicating that {CMTs} act as an integration point for both mechanisms controlling cellular growth anisotropy in lateral roots.
          , 
            A fundamental challenge in biology is to understand how plants, animals and other multicellular organisms make organs of various shapes and sizes. Plant cells are surrounded by rigid walls that fix them into their position relative to the surrounding cells. Therefore, neighbouring cells have to precisely coordinate how fast and in which directions they grow to form organs. In roots, for example, cells need to primarily grow in a longitudinal direction (along the length of the root), rather than radially, in order for the root to maintain its cylinder shape.
            Plant cell walls are made of fibres known as cellulose microfibrils, which are embedded within a matrix of other cell wall material. These fibres are much stiffer than the cell wall matrix, and their orientation controls in which direction a cell will grow. When microfibrils are lying parallel to each other, they limit cell growth in the direction they are orientated, causing cells to grow at right angles to the microfibrils. However, the way microfibrils are angled does not always fully expain the direction in which a cell will grow: for example, young cells in lateral roots (roots that branch out from the primary root) mainly grow in a longitudinal direction although their microfibrils are randomly arranged. This suggests other mechanisms are also involved in controlling in which direction a cell will grow.
            In order to grow, cells transport cell wall material and other cargo to the cell surface through different transport routes. A protein known as {RAB}-A5c controls a pathway directed to the edges of cells where two faces meet. It is not clear what exactly is transported in this edge-directed pathway, but root cells no longer grow in a longitudinal direction when {RAB}-A5c is inhibited. Previous studies have found that the edges of cells help to arrange cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall, but it is not clear whether {RAB}-A5c controls cell growth through this or another process. To address this question, Kirchhelle et al. used several different approaches to study the role {RAB}-A5c plays in how lateral roots grow in the small weed Arabidopsis thaliana.
            The experiments found that {RAB}-A5c controlled which direction cells in the lateral roots grew independently of cellulose microfibril orientation. Inhibiting {RAB}-A5c activity disturbed longitudinal growth, but unexpectedly increased the proportion of cellulose microfibrils that were arranged at right angles to the root’s main axis. Kirchhelle et al. propose that {RAB}-A5c controls growth direction by changing the cell wall’s mechanical properties at the edge where two cell faces meet. Cells can partially compensate for loss of this mechanism by increasing the number of microfibrils that are deposited in a parallel arrangement.
            These findings demonstrate that there are two separate mechanisms that control in which direction root cells grow. All land plants have versions of the {RAB}-A5c protein, suggesting that the new mechanism revealed in this work may also be found in other plants. Understanding how plant cells control growth may benefit agriculture in the future, for example, by providing new targets to develop herbicides against weeds.},

Previously unidentiﬁed membrane vesicles lying immediately beneath the plasma membrane at cell edges were revealed through localization of {RABA}5c, a plant {GTPase} of the Rab family of membrane-trafﬁcking regulators. Speciﬁc inhibition of {RAB}-A5c activity grossly perturbed cell geometry in developing lateral organs by interfering independently with growth anisotropy and cytokinesis without disrupting default membrane trafﬁcking. The initial loss of normal cell geometry can be explained by a failure to maintain wall stiffness specifically at geometric edges. {RAB}-A5c thus meets a requirement to specify this cellular spatial domain during organogenesis.},

How this pattern is generated is presently under debate. The ‘bending hypothesis’ proposes that lateral root primordia are initiated by a local accumulation of auxin at the convex side of bends resulting from deflections through obstacles, gravitropic bending, or other means. In contrast, the ‘oscillation hypothesis’ proposes the existence of an endogenous clock-type oscillator mechanism producing periodic pulses of gene expression in the root tip that determine the future sites of primordium initiation. Here we report physiological experiments dissecting periodic priming signals, pre-disposing the root to rhythmic lateral root formation, from bending-mediated signals responsible for the subsequent positioning of their initiation along the growing root. While the frequency of lateral roots can be promoted by auxin in the mature root, their positioning follows a pre-formed pattern determined by previous bending. Both types of signals turn out to be necessary, complementary components in an integrating concept of lateral root patterning.},

	abstract = {Cell division is essential for development and involves spindle assembly, chromosome separation, and cytokinesis. In plants, the genetic tools for controlling the events in cell division at the desired time are limited and ineffective owing to high redundancy and lethality. Therefore, we screened cell division–affecting compounds in
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              zygotes, whose cell division is traceable without time-lapse observations. We then determined the target events of the identified compounds using live-cell imaging of tobacco {BY}-2 cells. Subsequently, we isolated two compounds, {PD}-180970 and {PP}2, neither of which caused lethal damage. {PD}-180970 disrupted microtubule ({MT}) organization and, thus, nuclear separation, and {PP}2 blocked phragmoplast formation and impaired cytokinesis. Phosphoproteomic analysis showed that these compounds reduced the phosphorylation of diverse proteins, including {MT}-associated proteins ({MAP}70) and class {II} Kinesin-12. Moreover, these compounds were effective in multiple plant species, such as cucumber (
              Cucumis sativus

We use live imaging, modeling, and genetics to deconstruct these organ-level differences into their cell-level constituents: growth amount, direction, and differentiation. We show that leaf shape depends on the interplay of two growth modes: a conserved organ-wide growth mode that reﬂects differentiation; and a local, directional mode that involves the patterning of growth foci along the leaf edge. Shape diversity results from the distinct effects of two homeobox genes on these growth modes: {SHOOTMERISTEMLESS} broadens organwide growth relative to edge-patterning, enabling leaﬂet emergence, while {REDUCED} {COMPLEXITY} inhibits growth locally around emerging leaflets, accentuating shape differences created by patterning.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
          Plants depend on the combined action of a shoot-root-soil system to maintain their anchorage to the soil. Mechanical failure of any component of this system results in lodging, a permanent and irreversible inability to maintain vertical orientation. Models of anchorage in grass crops identify the compressive strength of roots near the soil surface as key determinant of resistance to lodging. Indeed, studies of disparate grasses report a ring of thickened, sclerenchyma cells surrounding the root cortex, present only at the base of nodal roots. Here, in the investigation of the development and regulation of this agronomically important trait, we show that development of these cells is uncoupled from the maturation of other secondary cell wall-fortified cells, and that cortical sclerenchyma wall thickening is stimulated by mechanical forces transduced from the shoot to the root. We also show that exogenous application of gibberellic acid stimulates thickening of lignified cell types in the root, including cortical sclerenchyma, but is not sufficient to establish sclerenchyma identity in cortex cells. Leveraging the ability to manipulate cortex development via mechanical stimulus, we show that cortical sclerenchyma development alters root mechanical properties and improves resistance to lodging. We describe transcriptome changes associated with cortical sclerenchyma development under both ambient and mechanically stimulated conditions and identify {SECONDARY} {WALL} {NAC}7 as a putative regulator of mechanically responsive cortex cell wall development at the root base.},

            Oat (Avena sativa) is a cereal crop whose grains are rich in (1,3;1,4)-β-D-glucan (mixed-linkage glucan or {MLG}), a soluble dietary fiber. In our study, we analyzed oat endosperm development in 2 Canadian varieties with differing {MLG} content and nutritional value. We confirmed that oat undergoes a nuclear type of endosperm development but with a shorter cellularization phase than barley (Hordeum vulgare). Callose and cellulose were the first polysaccharides to be detected in the early anticlinal cell walls at 11 days postemergence ({DPE}) of the panicle. Other polysaccharides such as heteromannan and homogalacturonan were deposited early in cellularization around 12 {DPE} after the first periclinal walls are laid down. In contrast to barley, heteroxylan deposition coincided with completion of cellularization and was detected from 14 {DPE} but was only detectable after demasking. Notably, {MLG} was the last polysaccharide to be laid down at 18 {DPE} within the differentiation phase, rather than during cellularization. In addition, differences in the spatiotemporal patterning of {MLG} were also observed between the 2 varieties. The lower {MLG}-containing cultivar {AC} Morgan (3.5\% w/w groats) was marked by the presence of a discontinuous pattern of {MLG} labeling, while labeling in the same walls in {CDC} Morrison (5.6\% w/w groats) was mostly even and continuous. {RNA}-sequencing analysis revealed higher transcript levels of multiple {MLG} biosynthetic cellulose synthase-like F ({CSLF}) and {CSLH} genes during grain development in {CDC} Morrison compared with {AC} Morgan that likely contributes to the increased abundance of {MLG} at maturity in {CDC} Morrison. {CDC} Morrison was also observed to have smaller endosperm cells with thicker walls than {AC} Morgan from cellularization onwards, suggesting the processes controlling cell size and shape are established early in development. This study has highlighted that the molecular processes influencing {MLG} content and deposition are more complex than previously imagined.},

	abstract = {Plants produce valuable natural products used for a wide variety of industrial applications. Since these molecules have important applications in a variety of industrial sectors, there is enormous interest in elucidating the biosynthetic pathways that are responsible for the production of these compounds. Identification of the genes that comprise these biosynthetic pathways has been enabled by gene-to-metabolite networks that are generated from transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets. Recent advances in both single-cell {RNA}-seq ({scRNA}-seq) and single-cell mass spectrometry metabolomics ({scMS}) have enabled the measurement of either gene expression or metabolite levels in individual cells. However, these individual datasets can only be used to indirectly correlate gene expression levels with metabolite concentrations at the single cell level. Here we demonstrate that both {scRNA}-seq and {scMS} can be applied to the same plant cell, thereby enabling direct comparisons between gene expression and metabolite levels. This multiplexing approach reveals both qualitative and quantitative correlations between metabolite levels and biosynthetic gene expression in individual cells. This integrated approach sheds light on the underlying processes driving complex plant biosynthesis.},

However, improving {AM} fungal association in crop species requires a fundamental understanding of host colonisation dynamics across varying agronomic and ecological contexts. To this end, we demonstrate the use of betalain pigments as in vivo visual markers for the occurrence and distribution of {AM} fungal colonisation by Rhizophagus irregularis in Medicago truncatula and Nicotiana benthamiana roots. Using established and novel {AM}-responsive promoters, we assembled multigene reporter constructs that enable the {AM}-controlled expression of the core betalain synthesis genes. We show that betalain colouration is specifically induced in root tissues and cells where fungal colonisation has occurred. In a rhizotron setup, we also demonstrate that betalain staining allows for the noninvasive tracing of fungal colonisation along the root system over time. We present {MycoRed}, a useful innovative method that will expand and complement currently used fungal visualisation techniques to advance knowledge in the field of {AM} symbiosis.},

It is adapted to poor soils due to the production of cluster roots, which are made of dozens of determinate lateral roots that drastically improve soil exploration and nutrient acquisition (mostly phosphate). Using long-read sequencing technologies, we provide a high-quality genome sequence of a cultivated accession of white lupin (2n = 50, 451 Mb), as well as de novo assemblies of a landrace and a wild relative. We describe a modern accession displaying increased soil exploration capacity through early establishment of lateral and cluster roots. We also show how seed quality may have been impacted by domestication in term of protein profiles and alkaloid content. The availability of a high-quality genome assembly together with companion genomic and transcriptomic resources will enable the development of modern breeding strategies to increase and stabilize white lupin yield.},

	abstract = {Chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C-based technology have revolutionized studies on chromosomal interactions and their role in gene regulation and chromosome organization. 3C allows the in vivo identiﬁcation of physical interactions between chromosomal regions. Such interactions are shown to play a role in various aspects of gene regulation, for example transcriptional activation of genes by remote enhancer sequences, or the silencing by Polycomb-group complexes. The last few years the number of publications involving chromosomal interactions increased signiﬁcantly. Until now, however, the vast majority of the studies reported are performed in yeast or animal systems. So far, studies on plant systems are extremely limited, possibly due to the plant-speciﬁc characteristics that hamper the implementation of the 3C technique. In this paper we provide a plant-speciﬁc 3C protocol, optimized for maize tissue, and an extensive discussion on (i) plant-speciﬁc adjustments to the protocol, and (ii) solutions to problems that may arise when optimizing the protocol for the tissue or plant of interest. Together, this paper should facilitate the application of 3C technology to plant tissue and stimulate studies on the 3D conformation of chromosomal regions and chromosomes in plants.},

	abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in regulating plant gravitropism. However, its precise role in this process remains uncertain. We have shown previously that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with Latrunculin B (Lat B) strongly promoted gravitropism in maize roots. These effects were most evident on a clinostat as curvature that would exceed 908 despite short periods of horizontal stimulation. To probe further the cellular mechanisms underlying these enhanced gravity responses, we extended our studies to roots of Arabidopsis. Similar to our observations in other plant species, Lat B enhanced the response of Arabidopsis roots to gravity. Lat B (100 {nM}) and a stimulation time of 5±10 min were suf®cient to induce enhanced bending responses during clinorotation. Lat B (100 {nM}) disrupted the ®ne actin ®lament network in different regions of the root and altered the dynamics of amyloplasts in the columella but did not inhibit the gravity-induced alkalinization of the columella cytoplasm. However, the duration of the alkalinization response during continuous gravistimulation was extended in Lat B-treated roots. Indirect visualization of auxin redistribution using the {DR}5:b-glucuronidase ({DR}5:{GUS}) auxin-responsive reporter showed that the enhanced curvature of Lat B-treated roots during clinorotation was accompanied by a persistent lateral auxin gradient. Blocking the gravity-induced alkalinization of the columella cytoplasm with caged protons reduced Lat B-induced curvature and the development of the lateral auxin gradient. Our data indicate that the actin cytoskeleton is unnecessary for the initial perception of gravity but likely acts to downregulate gravitropism by continuously resetting the gravitropic-signaling system.},

Cardamine hirsuta, a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, uses an explosive mechanism to disperse its seeds. We show that this trait evolved through morphomechanical innovations at different spatial scales. At the organ scale, tension within the fruit wall generates the elastic energy required for explosion. This tension is produced by differential contraction of fruit wall tissues through an active mechanism involving turgor pressure, cell geometry, and wall properties of the epidermis. Explosive release of this tension is controlled at the cellular scale by asymmetric lignin deposition within endocarp b cells—a striking pattern that is strictly associated with explosive pod shatter across the Brassicaceae plant family. By bridging these different scales, we present an integrated mechanism for explosive seed dispersal that links evolutionary novelty with complex trait innovation.},

              It is increasingly clear that plants perceive and respond to olfactory cues. Yet, knowledge about the specificity and sensitivity of such perception remains limited. We previously documented priming of anti-herbivore defenses in tall goldenrod plants (
              Solidago altissima
              ) by volatile emissions from a specialist herbivore, the goldenrod gall fly (
              Eurosta solidaginis
              ). Here, we explore the specific chemical cues mediating this interaction. We report that
              E,S
              -conophthorin, the most abundant component of the emission of male flies, elicits a priming response equivalent to that observed for the overall blend. Furthermore, while the strength of priming is dose dependent, plants respond even to very low concentrations of
              E,S
              -conophthorin relative to typical fly emissions. Evaluation of other blend components yields results consistent with the hypothesis that priming in this interaction is mediated by a single compound. These findings provide insights into the perceptual capabilities underlying plant defense priming in response to olfactory cues.},

Lateral roots ({LR}) represent an essential portion of cereal root systems, and are responsible for most of water and nutrients absorption from soil. {LAT} technology was recruited in this work to deeply visualize the initiation, development and emergence patterns of {LR} at the cellular level. Detailed fine anatomical structures of axial roots (841 μm diameter), large lateral roots (288 μm diameter) and small lateral roots (161 μm diameter) were visually revealed while all the three root classes are still vascularly connected. In the studied case, two small lateral roots emergence sites were distanced by approximately 700 μm along the axial large lateral root. The early stages of lateral root initiation and development (stages I–V) are visually demonstrated. Furthermore, fine anatomical structures shaping the vascular connection of emerged lateral root with parent roots and lignin distribution pattern were visually described. Digital staining method showed that lateral root cap is fortified with lignin, probably for protecting the emerging primordium meristem while mechanically crossing living cortical cell file of mother root. Interestingly, the {LAT} imaging could tackle the growth pattern of internal lateral root in sweet corn and rice where a lateral root could grow vertically inside aerenchyma lacunae instead of a horizontal growth through parent root cortex and protruding into the soil. Finally, {LAT} is a powerful imaging technology that can be utilized to deeply study other monocot and dicot plants for obtaining more knowledge about plant anatomical response to the surrounding environment, in addition to lateral root development and emergence.},

Here we describe Cardamine hirsuta, a close relative of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana, as an experimental system in which genetic and transgenic approaches can be deployed effectively for comparative studies. We present high-resolution genetic and cytogenetic maps for C. hirsuta and show that the genome structure of C. hirsuta closely resembles the eight chromosomes of the ancestral crucifer karyotype and provides a good reference point for comparative genome studies across the Brassicaceae. We compared morphological and physiological traits between C. hirsuta and A. thaliana and analysed natural variation in stamen number in which lateral stamen loss is a species characteristic of C. hirsuta. We constructed a set of recombinant inbred lines and detected eight quantitative trait loci that can explain stamen number variation in this population. We found clear phylogeographic structure to the genetic variation in C. hirsuta, thus providing a context within which to address questions about evolutionary changes that link genotype with phenotype and the environment.},

Here, we analysed the response of lateral roots to gravity and, consistently with previous observations, we showed that gravitropism was acquired slowly after emergence. Using a lateral root induction system, we studied the kinetics for the appearance of statoliths, phloem connections and auxin transporter gene expression patterns. We found that statoliths could not be detected until 1 day after emergence, whereas the gravitropic curvature of the lateral root started earlier. Auxin transporters modulate auxin distribution in primary root gravitropism. We found differences regarding {PIN}3 and {AUX}1 expression patterns between the lateral root and the primary root apices. Especially {PIN}3, which is involved in primary root gravitropism, was not expressed in the lateral root columella. Our work revealed new developmental transitions occurring in lateral roots after emergence, and auxin transporter expression patterns that might explain the specific response of lateral roots to gravity.},

Synthetic circuits that can record in vivo signaling networks have been critical in elucidating animal development. Here, we report on the transfer of this technology to plants using orthogonal serine integrases to mediate site-specific and irreversible {DNA} recombination visualized by switching between fluorescent reporters. When combined with promoters expressed during lateral root initiation, integrases amplify reporter signal and permanently mark all descendants. In addition, we present a suite of methods to tune the threshold for integrase switching, including: {RNA}/protein degradation tags, a nuclear localization signal, and a split-intein system. These tools improve the robustness of integrase-mediated switching with different promoters and the stability of switching behavior over multiple generations. Although each promoter requires tuning for optimal performance, this integrase toolbox can be used to build history-dependent circuits to decode the order of expression during organogenesis in many contexts.},

          Different plant species within the grasses were parallel targets of domestication, giving rise to crops with distinct evolutionary histories and traits. Key traits that distinguish these species are mediated by specialized cell types within organs. Here, we compare the transcriptomes of all cells within roots in three grasses—Zea mays (maize), Sorghum bicolor (sorghum), and outgroup Setaria viridis (Setaria). We first show that single-cell and single-nucleus {RNA}-seq provide complementary readouts of cell identity, warranting a combined analysis. Comparative cellular analysis shows that the transcriptomes of some cell types diverged more rapidly than others, in part by recruiting gene modules from other cell types. Furthermore, examining the whole genome duplication in maize, we detect extensive dosage compensation in surviving co-expressed homeologs, reinforcing genomic balance1. Homeolog pairs that underwent subfunctionalization2, partitioning their expression among cell types, represented a minor pattern but showed the highest rate of acquiring a novel (non-ancestral) domain. These results fit a conjecture in which mechanisms that maintain stoichiometric balance at the molecular level aid in homeolog retention for extended periods to allow new functions to arise. An unexpected synergy between spatial sub- and neo-functionalization then contributes to changes in transcriptional cell identity.},

Except for a few stages of plant infection under controlled conditions, nothing is known about the genes mobilized by the fungus throughout its life cycle, which may last several years in the field. We show here that about 9\% of the genes of this fungus are highly expressed during its interactions with its host plant. These genes are distributed into eight well-defined expression clusters, corresponding to specific infection lifestyles or to tissuespecific genes. All expression clusters are enriched in effector genes, and one cluster is perpetuity. It is made available under {aCC}-{BY}-{NC}-{ND} 4.0 International license.},

	abstract = {When building an organ, adjacent cells coordinate to form topologically stable junctions by integrating mechanosensitive signaling pathways. Positioning the newly formed tricellular junction in walled multicellular organisms is critical, as cells cannot migrate. The cell division site must avoid existing cellular junctions to prevent unstable four-way junctions. The microtubule preprophase band ({PPB}) is a guideline for the plant cell’s future cell division site. Yet, mutants impaired in {PPB} formation hardly display defects, suggesting the presence of an alternative mechanism. Here, we report the existence of a process that guides the cell division site close to an adjacent tricellular junction. This {PPB}-independent mechanism depends on the phosphoinositide phosphatase {SUPPRESSION} {OF} {ACTIN} 9 ({SAC}9): in the Arabidopsis mutant sac9-3, the cell plate abnormally attaches at two equidistant positions from an adjacent tricellular junction. Numerical simulations suggest that elastic energy accumulation at the subcellular level within walls, due to their rheological response to mechanical stresses, could act as positional cues revealing the positions of tricellular junctions. Moreover, perturbation of the root mechanical homeostasis results in four-way junction formation. This provides a scenario in which cells avoid four-way junction formation during cytokinesis through discrete subcellular mechanical hallmarks.},

How this diffusion barrier is structured has been partially defined, but its lignin polymerization and assembly steps remain elusive. Here, we characterize a family of dirigent proteins ({DPs}) essential for both the localized polymerization of lignin required for Casparian strip biogenesis in the cell wall and for attachment of the strip to the plasma membrane to seal the apoplast. We reveal a Casparian strip lignification mechanism that requires cooperation between {DPs} and the Schengen pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that {DPs} directly mediate lignin polymerization as part of this mechanism.

              Plant roots contain a lignin-based diffusion barrier called the Casparian strip that controls nutrient balance. Gao
              et al
              . found that a family of dirigent proteins controls the synthesis of lignin at the Casparian strip. The authors established a two-stage process of synthesis in which the dirigent proteins initiate lignin biosynthesis in plasma membrane patches. After this, gaps between the patches are filled in by the previously described Schengen pathway. The work extends our understanding of complex polysaccharide patterning in the plant extracellular space. —Madeleine Seale

Here, we identiﬁed an eight-corecomponent protein complex, the {TPLATE} complex, essential for plant growth via its role as major adaptor module for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This complex consists of evolutionarily unique proteins that associate closely with core endocytic elements. The {TPLATE} complex is recruited as dynamic foci at the plasma membrane preceding recruitment of adaptor protein complex 2, clathrin, and dynamin-related proteins. Reduced function of different complex components severely impaired internalization of assorted endocytic cargoes, demonstrating its pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Taken together, the {TPLATE} complex is an early endocytic module representing a unique evolutionary plant adaptation of the canonical eukaryotic pathway for clathrin-mediated endocytosis.},

Any geometrical similarities in the shape behind diversity and the underlying developmental constraints remain unclear. Plant root tip outlines commonly exhibit a dome shape, which likely performs physiological functions, despite the diversity in size and cellular organization among distinct root classes and/or species. We carried out morphometric analysis of the primary roots of ten angiosperm species and of the lateral roots ({LRs}) of Arabidopsis, and found that each root outline was isometrically scaled onto a parameter-free catenary curve, a stable structure adopted for arch bridges. Using the physical model for bridges, we analogized that localized and spatially uniform occurrence of oriented cell division and expansion force the {LR} primordia ({LRP}) tip to form a catenary curve. These growth rules for the catenary curve were verified by tissue growth simulation of developing {LRP} development based on time-lapse imaging. Consistently, {LRP} outlines of mutants compromised in these rules were found to deviate from catenary curves. Our analyses demonstrate that physics-inspired growth rules constrain plant root tips to form isometrically scalable catenary curves.},

	abstract = {Background: The root cap is a plant organ that ensheathes the meristematic stem cells at the root tip. Unlike other plant organs, the root cap shows a rapid cellular turnover, balancing constant cell generation by speciﬁc stem cells with the disposal of differentiated cells at the root cap edge. This cellular turnover is critical for the maintenance of root cap size and its position around the growing root tip, but how this is achieved and controlled in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana remains subject to contradictory hypotheses.
Results: Here, we show that a highly organized cell death program is the ﬁnal step of lateral root cap differentiation and that preparation for cell death is transcriptionally controlled by {ANAC}033/{SOMBRERO}. Precise timing of cell death is critical for the elimination of root cap cells before they fully enter the root elongation zone, which in turn is important in order to allow optimal root growth. Root cap cell death is followed by a rapid cell-autonomous corpse clearance and {DNA} fragmentation dependent on the S1-P1 type nuclease {BFN}1.
Conclusions: Based on these results, we propose a novel concept in plant development that recognizes programmed cell death as a mechanism for maintaining organ size and tissue homeostasis in the Arabidopsis root cap.},

            Rho of plant ({ROP}) proteins and the interactor of constitutively active {ROP} ({ICR}) family member {ICR}5/{MIDD}1 have been implicated to function as signaling modules that regulate metaxylem secondary cell wall patterning. Yet, loss-of-function mutants of {ICR}5 and its closest homologs have not been studied and, hence, the functions of these {ICR} family members are not fully established. Here, we studied the functions of {ICR}2 and its homolog {ICR}5. We show that {ICR}2 is a microtubule-associated protein that affects microtubule dynamics. Secondary cell wall pits in the metaxylem of Arabidopsis icr2 and icr5 single mutants and icr2 icr5 double mutants are smaller than those in wild-type Col-0 seedlings; however, they are remarkably denser, implying a complex function of {ICRs} in secondary cell wall patterning. {ICR}5 has a unique function in protoxylem secondary cell wall patterning, whereas icr2, but not icr5, mutants develop split root hairs, demonstrating functional diversification. Taken together, our results show that {ICR}2 and {ICR}5 have unique and cooperative functions as microtubule-associated proteins and as {ROP} effectors.},

	abstract = {Suberin is a fundamental plant biopolymer, found in protective tissues, such as seed coats, exodermis and endodermis of roots, the outer layers of stems and roots with secondary growth, as well as in wound-induced tissues. Its presence allows organs to resist various environmental stresses, such as pathogen attack, drought or excessive salt concentrations. Suberin is a mostly aliphatic polyester of long-chain fatty acids and alcohols, often co-occurring with lignin-like polymers in the same cells. Most suberizing cells appear to deposit suberin in the form of lamellae just outside of the plasma membrane, below the primary cell wall. The monomeric precursors of suberin are thought to be glycerated fatty acids, synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum. However, it has remained obscure how these monomers are transported outside of the cell, where they will be polymerized to form suberin lamellae. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular vesicular-tubular structures accumulate specifically in suberizing cells. By employing various, independent mutational and hormonal challenges, known to affect suberization in distinct ways, we demonstrate that their presence correlates perfectly with root suberization. Surprisingly, no endosomal compartment marker showed any conspicuous changes upon induction of suberization, suggesting that this compartment might not derive from endosomal multi-vesicular bodies, but possibly form directly from endoplasmic reticulum subdomains. Consistent with this, we could block formation of both, suberin deposition and vesicle accumulation by a pharmacogenetic manipulation affecting early steps in the secretory pathway. Whereas many previous reports have described extracellular vesicle occurrence in the context of biotic interactions, our results suggest a developmental role for extracellular vesicles in suberin formation.},

Through computational simulation we found that outer edges of cellular interfaces of the epidermis are hotspot for cell separating tensile stress. Characterization of the ultrastructure of those edges in planta revealed that they are locally thickened regions that harbor cellulose lamellae and pectin-based structural continuity across adjacent cells. We confirmed their dominant role for adhesion by studying mutants where those edges are defective and through direct mechanical testing. This reveals the key role of outer epidermal cell edges, rather than the middle lamella, in mediating cell-cell adhesion for tissue integrity in plants.},

              Morphogenesis of multicellular organs requires coordination of cellular growth. In plants, cell growth is determined by turgor pressure and the mechanical properties of the cell wall, which also glues cells together. Because plants have to integrate tissue-scale mechanical stresses arising through growth in a fixed tissue topology, they need to monitor cell wall mechanical status and adapt growth accordingly. Molecular factors have been identified, but whether cell geometry contributes to wall sensing is unknown. Here we propose that plant cell edges act as cell-wall-sensing domains during growth. We describe two Receptor-Like Proteins, {RLP}4 and {RLP}4-L1, which occupy a unique polarity domain at cell edges established through a targeted secretory transport pathway. We show that {RLP}4s associate with the cell wall at edges via their extracellular domain, respond to changes in cell wall mechanics and contribute to directional growth control in

We demonstrate that the previously reported rhythmic changes to {ARF}7 abundance in roots are modulated via autophagy and might occur in other tissues.

            Plant architecture is highly plastic and known to respond sensitively to nutritional changes. Although of great agronomic importance, the underlying molecular mechanisms that sense and transduce these cues into plant development and growth are poorly understood. Applying diverse genetic, biochemical, and microscopic approaches, we disclosed that signaling via the central, evolutionarily conserved fuel-sensor kinase Snf1-{RELATED} {KINASE}1 ({SnRK}1) initiates lateral root ({LR}) primordia formation in response to transient metabolic perturbations. This is accomplished by {SnRK}1-mediated activation of a signaling cascade involving the pivotal {LR} regulator {AUXIN} {RESPONSE} {FACTOR}19 ({ARF}19). We propose that this developmental priming strategy represents a cost-efficient approach to ensure rapid growth recovery after stress release, providing in competitive ecosystems a clear advantage in terms of Darwinian fitness.
          , 
            
              Plants adjust their energy metabolism to continuous environmental fluctuations, resulting in a tremendous plasticity in their architecture. The regulatory circuits involved, however, remain largely unresolved. In
              Arabidopsis
              , moderate perturbations in photosynthetic activity, administered by short-term low light exposure or unexpected darkness, lead to increased lateral root ({LR}) initiation. Consistent with expression of low-energy markers, these treatments alter energy homeostasis and reduce sugar availability in roots. Here, we demonstrate that the {LR} response requires the metabolic stress sensor kinase Snf1-{RELATED}-{KINASE}1 ({SnRK}1), which phosphorylates the transcription factor {BASIC} {LEUCINE} {ZIPPER}63 ({bZIP}63) that directly binds and activates the promoter of {AUXIN} {RESPONSE} {FACTOR}19 ({ARF}19), a key regulator of {LR} initiation.

Among members of the {TIR}1/{AFB} auxin receptor family, {AFB}1 has a primary role in this rapid response. However, the unique features that confer this speciﬁc function have not been identiﬁed. Here we show that the N-terminal region of {AFB}1, including the F-box domain and residues that contribute to auxin binding, is essential and sufﬁcient for its speciﬁc role in the rapid response. Substitution of the N-terminal region of {AFB}1 with that of {TIR}1 disrupts its distinct cytoplasm-enriched localization and activity in rapid root growth inhibition by auxin. Importantly, the N-terminal region of {AFB}1 is indispensable for auxin-triggered calcium inﬂux, which is a prerequisite for rapid root growth inhibition. Furthermore, {AFB}1 negatively regulates lateral root formation and transcription of auxin-induced genes, suggesting that it plays an inhibitory role in canonical auxin signaling. These results suggest that {AFB}1 may buffer the transcriptional auxin response, whereas it regulates rapid changes in cell growth that contribute to root gravitropism.},

            Photosynthesis in leaves generates the fixed-carbon resources and essential metabolites that support sink tissues, such as roots [1]. One of these products, sucrose, is known to promote primary root growth, but it is not clear what other molecules may be involved and whether other stages of root system development are affected by photosynthate levels [2]. Through a mutant screen to identify pathways regulating root system architecture, we identified a mutation in the
            {CYCLOPHILIN} 38
            (
            {CYP}38
            ) gene, which causes an accumulation of pre-emergent stage lateral roots, with a minor effect on primary root growth. {CYP}38 was previously reported to maintain the stability of Photosystem {II} ({PSII}) in chloroplasts [3].
            {CYP}38
            expression is enriched in the shoot and grafting experiments show that the gene acts non-cell autonomously to promote lateral root emergence. Growth of wild-type plants under low light conditions phenocopied the
            cyp38
            lateral root emergence phenotype as did the inhibition of {PSII}-dependent electron transport or {NADPH} production. Importantly, the
            cyp38
            root phenotype is not rescued by exogenous sucrose, suggesting the involvement of another metabolite. Auxin ({IAA}) is an essential hormone promoting root growth and its biosynthesis from tryptophan is dependent on reductant generated during photosynthesis [4,5]. Both {WT} seedlings grown under low light and
            cyp38
            mutants have highly diminished levels of {IAA} in root tissues. The
            cyp38
            lateral root defect is rescued by {IAA} treatment, revealing that photosynthesis promotes lateral root emergence partly through {IAA} biosynthesis. Metabolomic profiling shows that the accumulation of several defense-related metabolites are also photosynthesis-dependent, suggesting that the regulation of a number of energy-intensive pathways are down-regulated when light becomes limiting.},

Here, we describe a staining method compatible with single- and multiphoton confocal microscopy that allows for concurrent visualization of primary cell walls and distinct secondary depositions in one workflow. This protocol permits efficient separation of suberin- and lignin-specific signals with high resolution, enabling precise dissection of barrier constituents. Our approach is compatible with imaging of fluorescent proteins, and can thus complement genetic markers or aid the dissection of barriers in biotic root interactions. We further demonstrate applicability in deep root tissues of plant models and crops across phylogenetic lineages. Our optimized toolset will significantly advance our understanding of root barrier dynamics and function, and of their role in plant interactions with the rhizospheric environment.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying {LR} development in osmotic/salt stress conditions are poorly understood. Here we show that the gene encoding the {WRKY} transcription factor {WRKY}46 ({WRKY}46) is expressed throughout lateral root primordia ({LRP}) during early {LR} development and that expression is subsequently restricted to the stele of the mature {LR}. In osmotic/salt stress conditions, lack of {WRKY}46 (in loss-of-function wrky46 mutants) signiﬁcantly reduces, while overexpression of {WRKY}46 enhances, {LR} development. We also show that exogenous auxin largely restores {LR} development in wrky46 mutants, and that the auxin transport inhibitor 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid ({TIBA}) inhibits {LR} development in both wild-type ({WT}; Col-0) and in a line overexpressing {WRKY}46 ({OV}46). Subsequent analysis of abscisic acid ({ABA})-related mutants indicated that {WRKY}46 expression is down-regulated by {ABA} signaling, and up-regulated by an {ABA}-independent signal induced by osmotic/salt stress. Next, we show that expression of the {DR}5:{GUS} auxin response reporter is reduced in roots of wrky46 mutants, and that both wrky46 mutants and {OV}46 display altered root levels of free indole-3-acetic acid ({IAA}) and {IAA} conjugates. Subsequent {RT}-{qPCR} and {ChIP}-{qPCR} experiments indicated that {WRKY}46 directly regulates the expression of {ABI}4 and of genes regulating auxin conjugation. Finally, analysis of wrky46 abi4 double mutant plants conﬁrms that {ABI}4 acts downstream of {WRKY}46. In summary, our results demonstrate that {WRKY}46 contributes to the feedforward inhibition of osmotic/salt stress-dependent {LR} inhibition via regulation of {ABA} signaling and auxin homeostasis.},

              As roots grow through the soil, lateral branches develop to broaden the reach toward water and nutrients. Just where on the main root these lateral roots will develop is organized by an oscillatory root clock. Dickinson
              et al

              Arabidopsis
              , de novo organogenesis of lateral roots is patterned by an oscillatory mechanism called the root clock, which is dependent on unidentified metabolites. To determine whether retinoids regulate the root clock, we used a chemical reporter for retinaldehyde (retinal)–binding proteins. We found that retinal binding precedes the root clock and predicts sites of lateral root organogenesis. Application of retinal increased root clock oscillations and promoted lateral root formation. Expression of an
              Arabidopsis
              protein with homology to vertebrate retinoid-binding proteins, {TEMPERATURE} {INDUCED} {LIPOCALIN} ({TIL}), oscillates in the region of retinal binding to the reporter, confers retinal-binding activity in a heterologous system, and, when mutated, decreases retinal sensitivity. These results demonstrate a role for retinal and its binding partner in lateral root organogenesis.},

Functional analyses of rice transcription factors from {WUSCHELRELATED} {HOMEOBOX} and {PLETHORA} gene families reveal their non-redundant and species-specific roles in determining the root architecture. {WOX}10 and {PLT}1 regulate both shoot-borne crown roots and root-borne lateral roots, but {PLT}2 specifically controls lateral root development. {PLT}1 activates local auxin biosynthesis genes to promote crown root development. Interestingly, O. sativa {PLT} genes rescue lateral root primordia outgrowth defects of Arabidopsis plt mutants, demonstrating their conserved role in root primordia outgrowth irrespective of their developmental origin. Together, our findings unveil a molecular framework of tissue transdifferentiation during root primordia establishment, leading to the culmination of robust fibrous root architecture.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, protoderm/epidermis differentiates as a single cell layer at the outermost position. However, little is known about the molecular nature of the positional signals that achieve correct epidermal cell differentiation. Here, we propose that verylong-chain fatty acid-containing ceramides ({VLCFA}-Cers) mediate positional signals by stimulating the function of {ARABIDOPSIS} {THALIANA} {MERISTEM} {LAYER}1 ({ATML}1), a master regulator of protoderm/epidermis differentiation, during lateral root development. We show that {VLCFA}-Cers, which are synthesized predominantly in the outermost cells, bind to the lipid-binding domain of {ATML}1. Importantly, this cell type-specific protein-lipid association alters the activity of {ATML}1 protein and consequently restricts its expression to the protoderm/epidermis through a transcriptional feedback loop. Furthermore, establishment of a compartment, enriched with {VLCFAcontaining} sphingolipids, at the outer lateral membrane facing the external environment may function as a determinant of protodermal cell fate. Taken together, our results indicate that {VLCFA}-Cers play a pivotal role in directing protoderm/epidermis differentiation by mediating positional signals to {ATML}1.},

Based on this evidence, we propose a molecular model of an ultradian biological clock involving auxin-dependent degradation of an {AUX}/{IAA}-type transcription repressor as a flexible, frequency-controlling delay element.

The {FH}1 and {FH}2 domains of formins are conserved in plants, and we show that these domains of {AtFH}4 nucleate F-actin.

The {KNAT}6 {cDNA} is represented by two isoforms, suggesting that the {KNAT}6 transcript is subject to alternative splicing. Promoter-reporter and {RT}-{PCR} analysis conﬁrms expression of the {KNAT}6 gene in roots, and in particular in the phloem tissue close to the site of lateral root initiation, though not in the primary or lateral root meristem. The {KNAT}6 gene promoter activity is altered in pattern by treatment with exogenous auxin and in the rooty mutant background, with expression shifting distally in the root. In contrast, exogenous cytokinin suppresses {KNAT}6 promoter activity. {KNAT}6::{GFP} fusion protein is localized to the nucleus, consistent with the predicted function of {KNAT}6 as a transcription factor. Over-expression of the more abundant shorter isoform of the {KNAT}6 {cDNA}, but not of the less abundant longer form, leads to a lobed leaf phenotype, but no consistently aberrant root phenotype. Down-regulation of {KNAT}6 expression by {RNA} interference was associated with an increased total number of lateral roots.

Hence, establishing the architecture of plant promoters is fundamental to understanding gene expression. The determination of the regulatory circuits controlled by each {TF} and the identification of the cisregulatory sequences for all genes have been identified as two of the goals of the Multinational Coordinated Arabidopsis thaliana Functional Genomics Project by the Multinational Arabidopsis Steering Committee (June 2002).
Results: {AGRIS} is an information resource of Arabidopsis promoter sequences, transcription factors and their target genes. {AGRIS} currently contains two databases, {AtTFDB} (Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor database) and {AtcisDB} (Arabidopsis thaliana cis-regulatory database). {AtTFDB} contains information on approximately 1,400 transcription factors identified through motif searches and grouped into 34 families. {AtTFDB} links the sequence of the transcription factors with available mutants and, when known, with the possible genes they may regulate. {AtcisDB} consists of the 5' regulatory sequences of all 29,388 annotated genes with a description of the corresponding cis-regulatory elements. Users can search the databases for (i) promoter sequences, (ii) a transcription factor, (iii) a direct target genes for a specific transcription factor, or (vi) a regulatory network that consists of transcription factors and their target genes.
Conclusion: {AGRIS} provides the necessary software tools on Arabidopsis transcription factors and their putative binding sites on all genes to initiate the identification of transcriptional regulatory networks in the model dicotyledoneous plant Arabidopsis thaliana. {AGRIS} can be accessed from http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu.},

Here we present a series of technical improvements significantly enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of the Serial Lift-Out and {SOLIST} (Serialized On-grid Lift-In Sectioning for Tomography) procedures that are revolutionizing the field. We were able to extend the {cryoFIBSEM} session from 24 hours to 5 days without interruptions. In addition, we describe a modified silver-plated {EasyLiftTM} needle that eliminates the need of the copper or gold block between the original tungsten needle and the sample. Moreover, we describe a strategy that significantly reduces curtaining effects. Finally, we report a precise routine to target a lamella with a precision of approximately 1 µm in X,Y and Z. Together, these modifications considerably reduce contamination risk and preparation time, making cryo-lift-out techniques more accessible for routine structural biology applications on any type of tissue. Here, we demonstrate the power of our technique by targeting several specific wall structures that are of crucial importance for root available under {aCC}-{BY}-{NC}-{ND} 4.0 International license.},

            To establish three-dimensional structures/organs, plant cells continuously have to adapt the orientation of their division plane in a highly regulated manner. However, mechanisms underlying switches in division plane orientation remain elusive. Here, we characterize a viable double knockdown mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana group α Aurora ({AUR}) kinases, {AUR}1 and {AUR}2, (aur1-2 aur2-2), with a primary defect in lateral root formation and outgrowth. Mutant analysis revealed that aur1-2 aur2-2 lateral root primordia are built from randomly oriented cell divisions instead of distinct cell layers. This phenotype could be traced back to cytokinesis defects and misoriented cell plates during the initial anticlinal pericycle cell divisions that give rise to lateral root primordia. Complementation assays showed that the Arabidopsis α group Aurora kinases are functionally divergent from the single β group member {AUR}3 and that {AUR}1 functions in division plane orientation prior to cytokinesis. In addition to defective lateral root patterning, aur1-2 aur2-2 plants also show defects in orienting formative divisions during embryogenesis, divisions surrounding the main root stem cell niche, and divisions surrounding stomata formation. Taken together, our results put forward a central role for α Aurora kinases in regulating formative division plane orientation throughout development.},

After {PPB} disassembly, the positional information is preserved by the cortical division zone ({CDZ}). The formation of the {PPB} and its contribution to timely {CDZ} set-up involves activities of functionally distinct microtubule-associated proteins ({MAPs}) that interact physically and genetically to support robust division plane orientation in plants.

The study of lateral root initiation is however tedious, because it occurs only in a few cells inside the root and in an unpredictable manner. To circumvent this problem, a Lateral Root Inducible System ({LRIS}) has been developed. By treating seedlings consecutively with an auxin transport inhibitor and a synthetic auxin, highly controlled lateral root initiation occurs synchronously in the primary root, allowing abundant sampling of a desired developmental stage. The {LRIS} has first been developed for Arabidopsis thaliana, but can be applied to other plants as well. Accordingly, it has been adapted for use in maize (Zea mays). A detailed overview of the different steps of the {LRIS} in both plants is given. The combination of this system with comparative transcriptomics made it possible to identify functional homologs of Arabidopsis lateral root initiation genes in other species as illustrated here for the {CYCLIN} B1;1 ({CYCB}1;1) cell cycle gene in maize. Finally, the principles that need to be taken into account when an {LRIS} is developed for other plant species are discussed.},

A major determinant of the shape of a plant root system is the formation of lateral roots, allowing for expansion of the root system. Arabidopsis thaliana, with its simple root anatomy, has been extensively studied to reveal the genetic program underlying root branching. However, to get a more general understanding of lateral root development, comparative studies in species with a more complex root anatomy are required. Here, by combining optimized clearing methods and histology, we describe an atlas of lateral root development in Brachypodium distachyon, a wild, temperate grass species. We show that lateral roots initiate from enlarged phloem pole pericycle cells and that the overlying endodermis reactivates its cell cycle and eventually forms the root cap. In addition, auxin signaling reported by the {DR}5 reporter was not detected in the phloem pole pericycle cells or young primordia. In contrast, auxin signaling was activated in the overlying cortical cell layers, including the exodermis. Thus, Brachypodium is a valuable model to investigate how signaling pathways and cellular responses have been repurposed to facilitate lateral root organogenesis.},

                Development of symbiotic root nodules is a cytokinin-dependent process that is critical to nitrogen acquisition in legumes. The extent and manner in which root nodules contribute to whole-plant cytokinin and nitrogen supply signalling is unknown.
              
              
                
                  Using a combination of genetic, biochemical and physiological approaches, we characterised the role of cytokinin synthesis, export and perception in coordination of symbiotic nodule development and shoot growth in the legume
                  Lotus japonicus
                  .
                
              
              
                
                  {LjPup}1
                  encodes a plasma membrane localised cytokinin exporter with isopentenyladenine ({iP}) and
                  trans
                  -Zeatin ({tZ}) export capacity.
                  {LjPup}1
                  shows a distinct nodule-specific expression pattern with greatest transcript levels detected in mature nodules. Mutants accumulate more isopentenyladenine riboside ({iPR}) in nodule tissues and demonstrate hallmarks of reduced cytokinin signalling. Despite normal nodule numbers and function, shoot growth is markedly reduced in
                  Ljpup1
                  mutants, as well as in mutants impaired in {tZ} biosynthesis.
                
              
              
                We found symbiotic root nodules contribute to shoot growth via export of active cytokinins. A cytokinin exporter in the purine permease family thus contributes to long-distance cytokinin homeostasis regulating plant development.},

Roots of plants with a lower cytokinin status form {LR} primordia ({LRP}) in unusually close proximity, indicating a role for the hormone in regulating the positioning of {LRs} along the main root axis. Data obtained from cytokinin-synthesis mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana combined with gene expression analysis indicate that cytokinin synthesis by {IPT}5 and {LOG}4 occurring early during {LRP} initiation generates a local cytokinin signal abbreviating {LRP} formation in neighbouring pericycle cells. In addition, {IPT}3, {IPT}5, and {IPT}7 contribute to cytokinin synthesis in the vicinity of existing {LRP}, thus suppressing initiation of new {LRs}. Interestingly, mutation of {CYP}735A genes required for trans-zeatin biosynthesis caused strong defects in {LR} positioning, indicating an important role for this cytokinin metabolite in regulating {LR} spacing. Further it is shown that cytokinin and a known regulator of {LR} spacing, the receptor-like kinase {ARABIDOPSIS} {CRINKLY}4 ({ACR}4), operate in a non-hierarchical manner but might exert reciprocal control at the transcript level. Taken together, the results suggest that cytokinin acts as a paracrine hormonal signal in regulating root system architecture.},

              Plant roots integrate environmental signals with development using exquisite spatiotemporal control. This is apparent in the deposition of suberin, an apoplastic diffusion barrier, which regulates flow of water, solutes and gases, and is environmentally plastic. Suberin is considered a hallmark of endodermal differentiation but is absent in the tomato endodermis. Instead, suberin is present in the exodermis, a cell type that is absent in the model organism
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              . Here we demonstrate that the suberin regulatory network has the same parts driving suberin production in the tomato exodermis and the
              Arabidopsis
              endodermis. Despite this co-option of network components, the network has undergone rewiring to drive distinct spatial expression and with distinct contributions of specific genes. Functional genetic analyses of the tomato {MYB}92 transcription factor and {ASFT} enzyme demonstrate the importance of exodermal suberin for a plant water-deficit response and that the exodermal barrier serves an equivalent function to that of the endodermis and can act in its place.},

However, studies have focused primarily on the influence of prokaryotes on gold reduction and precipitation through a detoxification-oriented mechanism. Here we show, fungi, a major driver of mineral bioweathering, can initiate gold oxidation under Earth surface conditions, which is of significance for dissolved gold species formation and distribution. Presence of the gold-oxidizing fungus {TA}\_pink1, an isolate of
              Fusarium oxysporum

Our data further reveal that indigenous fungal diversity positively correlates with in situ gold concentrations. Hypocreales, the order of the gold-oxidizing fungus, show the highest centrality in the fungal microbiome of the auriferous environment. Therefore, we argue that the redox interaction between fungi and gold is critical and should be considered in gold biogeochemical cycling.},

We begin with a comparison of the core signaling pathways of these four hormones, which have been established through studies conducted in model organisms in the Angiosperms. With the advent of next-generation sequencing and advanced tools for genetic manipulation, the door to understanding the origins of hormone signaling mechanisms in plants beyond these few model systems has opened. For example, in-depth phylogenetic analyses of hormone signaling components are now being complemented by genetic studies in early diverging land plants. Here we discuss recent investigations of how basal land plants make and sense hormones.

An important question of {LR} development is how the connection of the primary root vasculature with that of the emerging {LR} is established and whether the pericycle and/or other cell types direct this process. Here, using clonal analysis and time-lapse experiments, we show that both the procambium and pericycle of the primary root ({PR}) affect the {LR} vascular connectivity in a coordinated manner. We show that during {LR} formation, procambial derivates switch their identity and become precursors of xylem cells. These cells, together with the pericycle-origin xylem, participate in the formation of what we call a ‘‘xylem bridge’’ ({XB}), which establishes the xylem connection between the {PR} and the nascent {LR}. If the parental protoxylem cell fails to differentiate, {XB} is still sometimes formed but via a connection with metaxylem cells, highlighting that this process has some plasticity. Using mutant analyses, we show that the early speciﬁcation of {XB} cells is determined by {CLASS} {III} {HOMEODOMAIN}-{LEUCINE} {ZIPPER} ({HD}-{ZIP} {III}) transcription factors ({TFs}). Subsequent {XB} cell differentiation is marked by the deposition of secondary cell walls ({SCWs}) in spiral and reticulate/scalariform patterns, which is dependent on the {VASCULAR}-{RELATED} {NAC}-{DOMAIN} ({VND}) {TFs}. {XB} elements were also observed in Solanum lycopersicum, suggesting that this mechanism may be more widely conserved in plants. Together, our results suggest that plants maintain vascular procambium activity, which safeguards the functionality of newly established lateral organs by assuring the continuity of the xylem strands throughout the root system.},

Here, we investigate this problem using the leaﬂet-bearing complex leaves of Cardamine hirsuta as a model. Leaﬂet development requires the action of two growth-repressing transcription factors: {REDUCED} {COMPLEXITY} ({RCO}), a homeodomain protein, and {CUP}-{SHAPED} {COTYLEDON}2 ({CUC}2), a {NAC}-domain protein. However, how their respective growth-repressive actions are integrated in space and time to generate complex leaf forms remains unknown. By using live imaging, we show that {CUC}2 and {RCO} are expressed in an interspersed fashion along the leaf margin, creating a distinctive striped pattern. We ﬁnd that this pattern is functionally important because forcing {RCO} expression in the {CUC}2 domain disrupts auxin-based marginal patterning and can abolish leaﬂet formation. By combining genetic perturbations with time-lapse imaging and cellular growth quantiﬁcations, we provide evidence that {RCO}-mediated growth repression occurs after auxin-based leaﬂet patterning and in association with the repression of cell proliferation. Additionally, through the use of genetic mosaics, we show that {RCO} is sufﬁcient to repress both cellular growth and proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner. This mechanism of growth repression is different to that of {CUC}2, which occurs in proliferating cells. Our ﬁndings clarify how the two growth repressors {RCO} and {CUC}2 coordinate to subdivide developing leaf primordia into distinct leaﬂets and generate the complex leaf form. They also indicate different relationships between growth repression and cell proliferation in the patterning and post-patterning stages of organogenesis.},

            Casparian strips ({CS}) are aligned bands of lignin-impregnated cell walls, building an extracellular diffusion barrier in roots. Their structure profoundly differs from tight junctions ({TJ}), analogous structures in animals.

A full {CASP} knock-out now reveals {CASPs} are not needed for localized lignification, since correctly positioned lignin microdomains still form in the mutant. Ultra-structurally, however, these microdomains are disorganized, showing excessive cell wall growth, lack of exclusion zone and matrix adhesion, and impaired exocyst dynamics. Proximity-labelling identifies a Rab-{GTPase} subfamily, known exocyst activators, as potential {CASP}-interactors and demonstrate their localization and function at the {CSD}. We propose that {CASP} microdomains displace initial secretory foci by excluding vesicle tethering factors, thereby ensuring rapid fusion of microdomains into a membrane-cell wall band that seals the extracellular space.},

              Few studies have asked at what spatial scale environmental stimuli regulate plant development and when during the patterning process these signals act. We have discovered that plant roots can sense microscale heterogeneity in water availability across their circumference, which causes dramatic differences in the patterning of tissues along this axis. Root branching is a target of such hydropatterning; lateral roots only form on the side of the main root contacting water in soil or agar. We show that hydropatterning is a conserved process in
              Arabidopsis
              , maize, and rice and reveal the importance of auxin biosynthesis and transport in regulating this process.
            
          , 
            
              The architecture of the branched root system of plants is a major determinant of vigor. Water availability is known to impact root physiology and growth; however, the spatial scale at which this stimulus influences root architecture is poorly understood. Here we reveal that differences in the availability of water across the circumferential axis of the root create spatial cues that determine the position of lateral root branches. We show that roots of several plant species can distinguish between a wet surface and air environments and that this also impacts the patterning of root hairs, anthocyanins, and aerenchyma in a phenomenon we describe as hydropatterning. This environmental response is distinct from a touch response and requires available water to induce lateral roots along a contacted surface. X-ray microscale computed tomography and 3D reconstruction of soil-grown root systems demonstrate that such responses also occur under physiologically relevant conditions. Using early-stage lateral root markers, we show that hydropatterning acts before the initiation stage and likely determines the circumferential position at which lateral root founder cells are specified. Hydropatterning is independent of endogenous abscisic acid signaling, distinguishing it from a classic water-stress response. Higher water availability induces the biosynthesis and transport of the lateral root-inductive signal auxin through local regulation of {TRYPTOPHAN} {AMINOTRANSFERASE} {OF}
              {ARABIDOPSIS}
              1 and {PIN}-{FORMED} 3, both of which are necessary for normal hydropatterning. Our work suggests that water availability is sensed and interpreted at the suborgan level and locally patterns a wide variety of developmental processes in the root.},

            Root branching is critical for plants to secure anchorage and ensure the supply of water, minerals, and nutrients. To date, research on root branching has focused on lateral root development in young seedlings. However, many other programs of postembryonic root organogenesis exist in angiosperms. In cereal crops, the majority of the mature root system is composed of several classes of adventitious roots that include crown roots and brace roots. In this Update, we initially describe the diversity of postembryonic root forms. Next, we review recent advances in our understanding of the genes, signals, and mechanisms regulating lateral root and adventitious root branching in the plant models Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), maize (Zea mays), and rice (Oryza sativa). While many common signals, regulatory components, and mechanisms have been identified that control the initiation, morphogenesis, and emergence of new lateral and adventitious root organs, much more remains to be done. We conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities facing root branching research.},

Cell wall thickenings are present in many different root cell types. They come in a variety of simple and more complex structures with varying composition of lignin and suberin and can change in response to environmental stressors. The majority of these root cell wall thickenings and cell types that contain them are absent in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana despite being present in most plant species. As a result, we know very little regarding their developmental control and function. Increasing evidence suggests that these structures are critical for responding to and facilitating adaptation to a wide array of stresses that a plant root experiences. These structures function in blocking apoplastic transport, oxygen, and water loss and enhancing root penetrative strength. In this review, we describe the most common types of cell wall thickenings in the outer cell types of plant roots—the velamen, exodermal thickenings, the sclerenchyma, and phi thickenings. Their cell-type dependency, morphology, composition, environmental responsiveness, and genetic control in vascular plants are discussed, as well as their potential to generate more stress-resilient roots in the face of a changing climate.},

Insights into how individual root tissues contribute to polymer formation are important for elucidation of ultrastructure, function, and development of these protective barriers. Although the pathways responsible for production of the barrier constituents are established, our models lack spatiotemporal resolution—especially in roots—thus, the source of monomeric barrier components is not clear. This is mainly due to our restricted ability to manipulate synthesis of the broadly important phenylpropanoid pathway, as mutants in this pathway display lethal or pleiotropic phenotypes. Here, we overcome this challenge by exploiting highly controlled in vivo repression systems. We provide strong evidence that autonomous production of phenylpropanoids is essential for establishment of the endodermal Casparian strip as well as adherence of the suberin matrix to the cell wall of endodermis and cork. Our work highlights that, in roots, the phenylpropanoid pathway is under tight spatiotemporal control and serves distinct roles in barrier formation across tissues and developmental zones. This becomes evident in the late endodermis, where repression of phenylpropanoid production leads to active removal of suberin in pre-suberized cells, indicating that endodermal suberin depositions might embody a steady state between continuous synthesis and degradation.},

In addition, we revealed a microbiota-driven mechanism controlling lateral root development that requires the induction of ethylene response pathways. We show that the microbial effects on root branching can be relevant for plant responses to environmental stresses. Thus, we discovered a microbiota-driven regulatory pathway controlling root branching plasticity that could contribute to plant adaptation to different ecosystems.},

We used the fact that most scrolls are made from animal skins to ‘‘ﬁngerprint’’ pieces based on {DNA} sequences. Genetic sorting of the scrolls illuminates their textual relationship and historical signiﬁcance. Disambiguating the contested relationship between Jeremiah fragments supplies evidence that some scrolls were brought to the Qumran caves from elsewhere; signiﬁcantly, they demonstrate that divergent versions of Jeremiah circulated in parallel throughout Israel (ancient Judea). Similarly, patterns discovered in non-biblical scrolls, particularly the Songs of the Sabbath Sacriﬁce, suggest that the Qumran scrolls represent the broader cultural milieu of the period. Finally, genetic analysis divorces debated fragments from the Qumran scrolls. Our study demonstrates that interdisciplinary approaches enrich the scholar’s toolkit.},

          Cell walls underpin the mechanics of cell growth, intercellular signalling, and defence against pathogenic organisms. β-(1,3)-glucans (also known as callose) are polysaccharides found in plants, fungi, and some bacterial species. In developing plant organs, callose accumulates around intercellular channels (plasmodesmata) controlling cell-to-cell communication. We developed monoclonal antibodies for the detection of β-(1,3)-glucans and using these identified distinct populations of callose differing in size and secondary structure. Callose sub-populations were in proximal but not overlapping cell wall microdomains implying distinct spatial and functional microenvironments. We also unveiled callose interaction with xyloglucan; another plant glycan regulating cell wall functions. This work challenges previous views demonstrating structural heterogeneity in plant callose and supporting interactions between glycans with roles in the regulation of cell wall properties and functions.},

            Various signals in tissue microenvironments are often unevenly distributed around cells. Cellular responses to asymmetric cell‐matrix adhesion in a 3D space remain generally unclear and are to be studied at the single‐cell resolution. Here, the authors developed a droplet‐based microfluidic approach to manufacture a pure population of single cells in a microscale layer of compartmentalized 3D hydrogel matrices with a tunable spatial presentation of ligands at the subcellular level. Cells elongate with an asymmetric presentation of the integrin adhesion ligand Arg‐Gly‐Asp ({RGD}), while cells expand isotropically with a symmetric presentation of {RGD}. Membrane tension is higher on the side of single cells interacting with {RGD} than on the side without {RGD}. Finite element analysis shows that a non‐uniform isotropic cell volume expansion model is sufficient to recapitulate the experimental results. At a longer timescale, asymmetric ligand presentation commits mesenchymal stem cells to the osteogenic lineage. Cdc42 is an essential mediator of cell polarization and lineage specification in response to asymmetric cell‐matrix adhesion. This study highlights the utility of precisely controlling 3D ligand presentation around single cells to direct cell polarity for regenerative engineering and medicine.},

            Cas9, has been used in numerous different plant species. However, to what extent multiple independent loci can be targeted simultaneously by multiplexing has not been well-documented. Here, we developed a toolkit, based on a highly intron-optimized {zCas}9i gene, which allows assembly of nuclease constructs expressing up to 32 {sgRNAs}. We used this toolkit to explore the limits of multiplexing in two major model species, and report on isolation of transgene-free octuple

            and duodecuple (12x)

We identify a duodecuple mutant line by a combination of phenotypic screening and amplicon sequencing.

            We have developed a fluorescent protein, {mGreenLantern}, that features exceptionally high brightness in mouse, bacterial, and human cells (up to sixfold brighter than {EGFP}) and have demonstrated its superior ability to highlight neuronal morphology compared to {EGFP} and {EYFP}. Screening fluorescent protein mutants based on whole-cell brightness while evaluating expression kinetics in lysate enabled us to identify variants exhibiting striking divergences between their computed spectroscopic brightness and actual performance in cells. {mGreenLantern} additionally features unusually high chemical and thermodynamic stability and is compatible with existing {GFP} filter sets, excitation sources, commercial {EGFP} antibodies, expansion microscopy, and whole-brain tissue clearing. Our hypothesis-driven engineering strategy represents a generalizable method with great potential to enhance the performance of constitutive reporters and {GFP}-based biosensors.
          , 
            Although ubiquitous in biological studies, the enhanced green and yellow fluorescent proteins ({EGFP} and {EYFP}) were not specifically optimized for neuroscience, and their underwhelming brightness and slow expression in brain tissue limits the fidelity of dendritic spine analysis and other indispensable techniques for studying neurodevelopment and plasticity. We hypothesized that {EGFP}’s low solubility in mammalian systems must limit the total fluorescence output of whole cells, and that improving folding efficiency could therefore translate into greater brightness of expressing neurons. By introducing rationally selected combinations of folding-enhancing mutations into {GFP} templates and screening for brightness and expression rate in human cells, we developed {mGreenLantern}, a fluorescent protein having up to sixfold greater brightness in cells than {EGFP}. {mGreenLantern} illuminates neurons in the mouse brain within 72 h, dramatically reducing lag time between viral transduction and imaging, while its high brightness improves detection of neuronal morphology using widefield, confocal, and two-photon microscopy. When virally expressed to projection neurons in vivo, {mGreenLantern} fluorescence developed four times faster than {EYFP} and highlighted long-range processes that were poorly detectable in {EYFP}-labeled cells. Additionally, {mGreenLantern} retains strong fluorescence after tissue clearing and expansion microscopy, thereby facilitating superresolution and whole-brain imaging without immunohistochemistry. {mGreenLantern} can directly replace {EGFP}/{EYFP} in diverse systems due to its compatibility with {GFP} filter sets, recognition by {EGFP} antibodies, and excellent performance in mouse, human, and bacterial cells. Our screening and rational engineering approach is broadly applicable and suggests that greater potential of fluorescent proteins, including biosensors, could be unlocked using a similar strategy.},

              Root architecture is an important trait that is shaped by the formation of primary roots, lateral roots, and adventitious roots. Here, we show that three {PLETHORA} ({PLT}) transcription factors are the key molecular triggers for the de novo organ patterning during

          , 
            
              Plant development is characterized by repeated initiation of meristems, regions of dividing cells that give rise to new organs. During lateral root ({LR}) formation, new {LR} meristems are specified to support the outgrowth of {LRs} along a new axis. The determination of the sequential events required to form this new growth axis has been hampered by redundant activities of key transcription factors. Here, we characterize the effects of three {PLETHORA} ({PLT}) transcription factors, {PLT}3, {PLT}5, and {PLT}7, during {LR} outgrowth. In
              plt3plt5plt7
              triple mutants, the morphology of lateral root primordia ({LRP}), the auxin response gradient, and the expression of meristem/tissue identity markers are impaired from the “symmetry-breaking” periclinal cell divisions during the transition between stage I and stage {II}, wherein cells first acquire different identities in the proximodistal and radial axes.

Reintroduction of any {PLT} clade member in the mutant primordia completely restores layer identities at stage {II} and rescues mutant defects in meristem and tissue establishment. Therefore, all

Despite these differences, it is becoming apparent that shoot and root apical and vascular meristems share significant gene expression patterns. Class {III} {HD}-Zip genes are required for the formation of a functional shoot apical meristem. In addition, Class {III} {HD}-Zip and {KANADI} genes function in patterning lateral organs and vascular bundles produced from the shoot apical and vascular meristems, respectively. We utilize both gain- and loss-of-function mutants and gene expression patterns to analyze the function of Class {III} {HD}-Zip and {KANADI} genes in Arabidopsis roots. Here we show that both Class {III} {HD}-Zip and {KANADI} genes play roles in the ontogeny of lateral roots and suggest that Class {III} {HD}-Zip gene activity is required for meristematic activity in the pericycle analogous to its requirement in the shoot apical meristem.},

Here, we characterize the {ABA}-induced suberization and ligniﬁcation of root tissues across eight galegoid legumes. Chickpea exhibited suberin deposition speciﬁcally in the outermost cortex, forming a functional apoplastic barrier. Transcriptomics of chickpea roots revealed {ABA}-induced programs that were temporally separated, speciﬁcally, a rapid program with the general {ABA} response, and a delayed program of suberin biosynthesis. We identiﬁed putative {MYB} transcription factors that link the {ABA} response to the suberin biosynthesis in chickpea.

	abstract = {Land plants produce a cuticle, an extracellular hydrophobic layer that covers aerial organs and is involved in many critical protective roles, most notably in preventing desiccation. The predominant component of the cuticle is the lipidic polyester, cutin, which is deposited in the epidermal primary cell wall. Most of cutin of tomato fruit, a model for cuticle research, is polymerized by the extracellular {GDSL}-hydrolase enzyme {CUTIN} {SYNTHASE}-{LIKE} 1 ({CUS}1). However, other enzymes involved in cutin assembly remain to be identified and characterized. In this current study, we investigated whether other {GDSL}-hydrolases that are highly expressed in fruit epidermis might also contribute to cutin polymerization and restructuring. Candidates include homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana {CUTICLE} {DESTRUCTIVE} {FACTOR} 1 ({CDEF}1), which has been reported to catalyze cutin hydrolysis, as well as other phylogenetically diverse and distantly related {GDSL}-hydrolases. We determined that members of the {CUS} and {CDEF} families can catalyze the transesterification of cutin precursors in vitro, and can modify tomato fruit cutin structure in semi-in vivo assays. Tomato mutant knockout lines of {CUS} and {CDEF} genes generated by {CRISPR}/Cas9 and cross mutations with cus1 (previously cd1) were found to exhibit different fruit and flower phenotypes related to cutin assembly, including an effect on cutin monomer esterification, composition and content, cutin nanoridge formation in flowers, fruit cuticle permeability and permeance. Characterization of the mutant phenotypes, in combination with the enzyme analysis and bioassays, revealed distinct differences in the contribution of {CUS} and {CDEF} enzymes to cutin biosynthesis and remodeling. Our analysis also revealed unexpected spatiotemporal variation in cutin polymerization and structure coordinated by distinct {GDSLhydrolase} enzymes over the fruit surface, which further suggests great complexity in cutin deposition and cuticle functions during organ development.},

            Cytokinesis is a key process in the development of multicellular organisms, through both formative and proliferative divisions. In land plants, successful cytokinesis requires precise targeting of Golgi-derived vesicles to the future division plane by the phragmoplast, a cytoskeletal structure that undergoes continuous remodelling. Endomembrane trafficking and phragmoplast remodelling are tightly coupled, indicating the existence of active crosstalk. However, although many molecular regulators of membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organisation are known, it remains poorly understood how these processes are co-ordinated. Here, we describe a regulatory module consisting of the membrane-associated {GTPase} {RAB}-A2a, cytoskeleton-associated Class {II} Kinesin-12s, and the Fused kinase orthologue {TIO}. We provide evidence that the interaction between these molecules at the midzone is essential for cytokinesis in

Because biological form often follows function, the unique shape of these cells suggests that they must serve some adaptive purpose for the plant. We previously proposed that these intricate shapes provide an effective strategy for reducing mechanical stress on the cell wall when epidermal cells undergo growth in more than one direction. Here we analyze a large selection of living and paleo plant species and find that the ability to make puzzle cells is a shared feature across all plant species, although their presence can be hidden as it varies depending on the organ, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. Computational modeling of Arabidopsis and maize epidermal cells revealed that presence and patterning of lobes is a dynamic process that is intricately linked to the growth history and environmental context of the plant organ. Conversely, disrupted lobeyness in mutants or with drug treatments affects plant development and leads to compensatory strategies. We propose that the mechanism underlying the formation of puzzle-shaped cells is likely conserved among higher plants and is a response to a developmental constraint driven by growth and mechanical stress.},

          Pressurized cells with strong walls make up the hydrostatic skeleton of plants.

Together with {LRX}1, it directs the compaction of charged pectin polymers at the root hair tip into periodic circumferential rings. Free {RALF}22 induces the formation of a complex with {LORELEI}-{LIKE}-{GPI}-{ANCHORED} {PROTEIN} 1 ({LLG}1) and {FERONIA} ({FER}), triggering adaptive cellular responses.

            Generative pre-trained models have achieved remarkable success in various domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Specifically, the combination of large-scale diverse datasets and pre-trained transformers has emerged as a promising approach for developing foundation models. Drawing parallels between linguistic constructs and cellular biology — where texts comprise words, similarly, cells are defined by genes — our study probes the applicability of foundation models to advance cellular biology and genetics research. Utilizing the burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have pioneered the construction of a foundation model for single-cell biology, {scGPT}, which is based on generative pre-trained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that {scGPT}, a generative pre-trained transformer, effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through the further adaptation of transfer learning, {scGPT} can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications.

            Gene functional descriptions, which are typically derived from sequence similarity to experimentally validated genes in a handful of model species, offer a crucial line of evidence when searching for candidate genes that underlie trait variation. Plant responses to environmental cues, including gene expression regulatory variation, represent important resources for understanding gene function and crucial targets for plant improvement through gene editing and other biotechnologies. However, even after years of effort and numerous large-scale functional characterization studies, biological roles of large proportions of protein coding genes across the plant phylogeny are poorly annotated. Here we describe the Joint Genome Institute ({JGI}) Plant Gene Atlas, a public and updateable data resource consisting of transcript abundance assays from 2,090 samples derived from 604 tissues or conditions across 18 diverse species. We integrated across these diverse conditions and genotypes by analyzing expression profiles, building gene clusters that exhibited tissue/condition specific expression, and testing for transcriptional modulation in response to environmental queues. For example, we discovered extensive phylogenetically constrained and condition-specific expression profiles across many gene families and genes without any functional annotation. Such conserved expression patterns and other tightly co-expressed gene clusters let us assign expression derived functional descriptions to 64,620 genes with otherwise unknown functions. The ever-expanding Gene Atlas resource is available at {JGI} Plant Gene Atlas (

            2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a synthetic analogue of the plant hormone auxin that is commonly used in many
            in vitro
            plant regeneration systems, such as somatic embryogenesis ({SE}). Its effectiveness in inducing {SE}, compared to the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid ({IAA}), has been attributed to the stress triggered by this compound rather than its auxin activity. However, this hypothesis has never been thoroughly tested. Here we used a library of 40 2,4-D analogues to test the structure-activity relationship with respect to the capacity to induce {SE} and auxin activity in
            Arabidopsis thaliana
            . Four analogues induced {SE} as effectively as 2,4-D and 13 analogues induced {SE} but were less effective. Based on root growth inhibition and auxin response reporter expression, the 2,4-D analogues were classified into different groups, ranging from very active auxins to not active. A halogen at the 4-position of the aromatic ring was important for auxin activity, whereas a halogen at the 3-position resulted in reduced activity. Moreover, a small substitution at the carboxylate chain was tolerated, as was extending the carboxylate chain with two but not with one carbon. In the process, we also identified two 2,4-D analogues as efficient inducers of adventitious root formation and several possible anti-auxins. The auxin activity of the 2,4-D analogues was consistent with their simulated {TIR}1-Aux/{IAA} coreceptor binding characteristics. A strong correlation was observed between {SE} induction efficiency and auxin activity, indicating that the stress-related effects triggered by 2,4-D that are considered important for {SE} induction are down-stream of auxin signaling.},

            The shape of tomato fruits is closely correlated to microtubule organization and the activity of microtubule associated proteins ({MAP}), but insights into the mechanism from a cell biology perspective are still largely elusive. Analysis of tissue expression profiles of different microtubule regulators revealed that functionally distinct classes of
            {MAPs}
            are highly expressed during fruit development. Among these, several members of the plant-specific
            {MAP}70
            family are preferably expressed at the initiation stage of fruit development. Transgenic tomato lines overexpressing {SlMAP}70 produced elongated fruits that show reduced cell circularity and microtubule anisotropy, while {SlMAP}70 loss-of-function mutant showed an opposite effect with flatter fruits. Microtubule anisotropy of fruit endodermis cells exhibited dramatic rearrangement during tomato fruit development, and {SlMAP}70-1 is likely implicated in cortical microtubule organization and fruit elongation throughout this stage by interacting with {SUN}10/{SlIQD}21a. The expression of

            ) induces microtubule stabilization and prevents its dynamic rearrangement, both activities are essential for fruit shape establishment after anthesis. Together, our results identify {SlMAP}70 as a novel regulator of fruit elongation, and demonstrate that manipulating microtubule stability and organization at the early fruit developmental stage has a strong impact on fruit shape.},

It constitutes a mystery with transcending consequences from plant to human genetics. This mystery lies in the fact that a large proportion of phenotypes are not explained by unique or simple genomic modifications. One has to invoke genetic interactions among different loci, also known as epistasis, to partly account for it. However, current {GWAS} statistical models are moderately scalable, very sensitive to False Discovery Rate ({FDR}) corrections and, even combined with High Performance Computing ({HPC}), they can take years to evaluate for a full combinatorial epistatic space for a single phenotype. Here we propose a modeling approach, named Next-Gen {GWAS} ({NGG}) that evaluates, within hours, {\textgreater}60 billions of single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) combinatorial first-order interactions, on a reasonable computer power. We first benchmark {NGG} on state of the art {GWAS} model results, and applied this to Arabidopsis thaliana providing 2D epistatic maps at gene resolution. We demonstrate on several phenotypes that a large proportion of the missing heritability can i) be retrieved with this modeling approach, ii) indeed lies in epistatic interactions and iii) can be used to improve phenotype prediction.},

            Arabidopsis thaliana
            entails the auxin-induced activation of founder cells located in the pericycle. While the allocation of sugars to roots influences root branching, how sugar availability is sensed for auxin-triggered formation of {LRs} remains unknown. Here, we combine metabolic profiling with cell-specific genetic interference to show that {LR} formation is an important sink for carbohydrate accompanied by a switch to glycolysis. We show that the target-of-rapamycin ({TOR}) kinase is locally activated in the pericycle and the founder cells and that both chemical and genetic inhibition of {TOR} kinase lead to a block of {LR} initiation. {TOR} marginally affects the auxin-induced transcriptional response of the pericycle but modulates the translation of {ARF}19, {ARF}7 and {LBD}16, three key targets of auxin signalling. These data place {TOR} as a gatekeeper for post-embryonic {LR} formation that integrates local auxin-dependent pathways with systemic metabolic signals, modulating the translation of auxin induced gene expression.},

            A large number of genes involved in lateral root ({LR}) organogenesis have been identified over the last decade using forward and reverse genetic approaches in Arabidopsis thaliana. Nevertheless, how these genes interact to form a {LR} regulatory network largely remains to be elucidated. In this study, we developed a time-delay correlation algorithm ({TDCor}) to infer the gene regulatory network ({GRN}) controlling {LR} primordium initiation and patterning in Arabidopsis from a time-series transcriptomic data set. The predicted network topology links the very early-activated genes involved in {LR} initiation to later expressed cell identity markers through a multistep genetic cascade exhibiting both positive and negative feedback loops. The predictions were tested for the key transcriptional regulator {AUXIN} {RESPONSE} {FACTOR}7 node, and over 70\% of its targets were validated experimentally. Intriguingly, the predicted {GRN} revealed a mutual inhibition between the {ARF}7 and {ARF}5 modules that would control an early bifurcation between two cell fates. Analyses of the expression pattern of {ARF}7 and {ARF}5 targets suggest that this patterning mechanism controls flanking and central zone specification in Arabidopsis {LR} primordia.},

The prevailing belief is that the plant hormone auxin serves as a mobile signal transmitter, responsible for interorgan communication, including light-controlled shoot-to-root connections. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the transcription factor {HY}5 assumes the role as a mobile shoot-to-root signal transmitter. Here, we provide evidence that photosynthetic sucrose produced in the shoot acts as the long-distance signal carrier regulating the local, tryptophan-based biosynthesis of auxin in the {LR} generation zone of the primary root tip, where the {LR} clock controls the pace of {LR} initiation in an auxin-tunable manner. Synchronization of {LR} formation with primary root elongation allows the adjustment of overall root growth to the photosynthetic performance of the shoot and the maintenance of a constant {LR} density during light-dark changes in a variable light environment.},

While the endodermis is present in nearly all plant roots, the exodermis, characterized by Casparian strips and suberin lamellae is absent in certain plant species. The exodermis can be classified into three types: uniform, dimorphic, and inducible exodermis. Apart from its role in water and ion transport, the exodermis acts as a protective barrier against harmful substances present in the external environment. Furthermore, the exodermis is a complex barrier influenced by various environmental factors, and its resistance to water and ions varies depending on the type of exodermis and the maturity of the root. Therefore, investigations concerning the exodermis necessitate a plant-specific approach. However, our current understanding of the exodermal physiological functions and molecular mechanisms governing its development is limited due to the absence of an exodermis in the model plant Arabidopsis. Due to that, unfortunately, the exodermis has been largely overlooked until now.

              The consumption of plants by herbivores has driven the evolution of many diverse plant defense chemicals to which herbivores have constantly adapted. The transmission of chemical information at the community level is less known but important given the plethora of plant and herbivore species, especially in tropical communities. Zu
              et al.
              propose an information “arms race” approach to explain plant-herbivore chemical communication at the community level (see the Perspective by Solé). To test their conceptual framework, they used field data of herbivore-plant interactions and plant–volatile organic compound associations in a tropical dry forest. Their approach provides an understanding of the functioning and persistence of systems where individuals send and receive information in the form of signals to which other individuals react and, in turn, affect the behavior of other participants in these systems.

            An information theory framework for chemical signaling explains the evolutionary “arms race” between plants and insect herbivores.
          , 
            Plants emit an extraordinary diversity of chemicals that provide information about their identity and mediate their interactions with insects. However, most studies of this have focused on a few model species in controlled environments, limiting our capacity to understand plant-insect chemical communication in ecological communities. Here, by integrating information theory with ecological and evolutionary theories, we show that a stable information structure of plant volatile organic compounds ({VOCs}) can emerge from a conflicting information process between plants and herbivores. We corroborate this information “arms race” theory with field data recording plant-{VOC} associations and plant-herbivore interactions in a tropical dry forest. We reveal that plant {VOC} redundancy and herbivore specialization can be explained by a conflicting information transfer. Information-based communication approaches can increase our understanding of species interactions across trophic levels.},

            Multicellular organisms result from complex developmental processes largely orchestrated through the quantitative spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. Yet, obtaining absolute counts of messenger {RNAs} at a three-dimensional resolution remains challenging, especially in plants, owing to high levels of tissue autofluorescence that prevent the detection of diffraction-limited fluorescent spots. In situ hybridization methods based on amplification cycles have recently emerged, but they are laborious and often lead to quantification biases. In this article, we present a simple method based on single-molecule {RNA} fluorescence in situ hybridization to visualize and count the number of {mRNA} molecules in several intact plant tissues. In addition, with the use of fluorescent protein reporters, our method also enables simultaneous detection of {mRNA} and protein quantity, as well as subcellular distribution, in single cells. With this method, research in plants can now fully explore the benefits of the quantitative analysis of transcription and protein levels at cellular and subcellular resolution in plant tissues.},

Auxin is key for {LR} formation, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we report that Arabidopsis {ERF}1 inhibits {LR} emergence by promoting local auxin accumulation with altered distribution and regulating auxin signaling. Loss of {ERF}1 increases {LR} density compared with the wild type, whereas {ERF}1 overexpression causes the opposite phenotype. {ERF}1 enhances auxin transport by upregulating {PIN}1 and {AUX}1, resulting in excessive auxin accumulation in the endodermal, cortical, and epidermal cells surrounding {LR} primordia. Furthermore, {ERF}1 represses {ARF}7 transcription, thereby downregulating the expression of cell-wall remodeling genes that facilitate {LR} emergence. Together, our study reveals that {ERF}1 integrates environmental signals to promote local auxin accumulation with altered distribution and repress {ARF}7, consequently inhibiting {LR} emergence in adaptation to ﬂuctuating environments.},

When grown in blue light for 12 d, mutant seedlings (cry1) showed increased growth of lateral roots, while {CRY}1-overexpressing transgenic seedlings ({CRY}1ox) exhibited a marked decrease. Lateral roots growth of {CRY}1ox could be stimulated by auxin, but expression of {PIN}1 (efﬂux carrier of polar auxin transport) was strongly reduced. Contrary, the cry1 mutation showed the opposite effect, indicating that blue light and the auxin-signaling pathway interact in lateral roots growth of Arabidopsis. The free {IAA} content in {CRY}1ox roots was half of that in wild type and cry1 mutant roots. Moreover, the content of ﬂavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin), which act as endogenous negative regulators of auxin transport, increased in {CRY}1ox seedlings. Taken together, these results suggest that Arabidopsis {CRY}1 restrains lateral roots growth by inhibiting auxin transport.},

Here, we have used a yeast-two-hybrid screen and subsequent in vivo interaction studies in plants by ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ({FRET})-ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ({FLIM}) analysis to identify two microtubule binding proteins, {KLCR}1 (kinesin-light-chain-related protein 1) and {IQD}2 ({IQ}67-domain 2), that interact with the actin binding protein {NET}3C and form a component of plant {EPCS} that mediates the link between the actin and microtubule networks. The {NET}3C-{KLCR}1-{IQD}2 module, acting as an actin-microtubule bridging complex, has a direct inﬂuence on {ER} morphology and {EPCS} structure. Their loss-of-function mutants, net3a/{NET}3C {RNAi}, klcr1, or iqd2, exhibit defects in pavement cell morphology, which we suggest is linked to the disorganization of both actin ﬁlaments and microtubules. In conclusion, our results reveal a novel cytoskeletal-associated complex, which is essential for the maintenance and organization of cytoskeletal structure and {ER} morphology at the {EPCS} and for normal plant cell morphogenesis.},

Auxinbinding protein 1 ({ABP}1) physically interacts with quintessential transmembrane kinases ({TMKs}) and was proposed to act as an extracellular auxin receptor, but its role was disputed because abp1 knockout mutants lack obvious morphological phenotypes. Here, we identiﬁed two new auxin-binding proteins, {ABL}1 and {ABL}2, that are localized to the apoplast and directly interact with the extracellular domain of {TMKs} in an auxin-dependent manner. Furthermore, functionally redundant {ABL}1 and {ABL}2 genetically interact with {TMKs} and exhibit functions that overlap with those of {ABP}1 as well as being independent of {ABP}1. Importantly, the extracellular domain of {TMK}1 itself binds auxin and synergizes with either {ABP}1 or {ABL}1 in auxin binding. Thus, our ﬁndings discovered auxin receptors {ABL}1 and {ABL}2 having functions overlapping with but distinct from {ABP}1 and acting together with {TMKs} as co-receptors for extracellular auxin.},

By screening allotetraploid wild rice inventory, we identiﬁed one genotype of Oryza alta ({CCDD}), polyploid rice 1 ({PPR}1), and established two important resources for its de novo domestication: (1) an efﬁcient tissue culture, transformation, and genome editing system and (2) a high-quality genome assembly discriminated into two subgenomes of 12 chromosomes apiece. With these resources, we show that six agronomically important traits could be rapidly improved by editing O. alta homologs of the genes controlling these traits in diploid rice.

              et al.
              show that cytokinin promotes nuclear localization of the transcription factor {MYB}3R4, which activates the expression of two importins and genes that tip the cell into the next phase of the cell cycle. The importins facilitate further {MYB}3R4 accumulation within the nucleus, accelerating the progression into mitosis. {MYB}3R4 and the importins dissipate when the nuclear membrane dissolves at prometaphase, so there is only one round of mitotic activation per cell cycle.

          , 
            
              Mitogens trigger cell division in animals. In plants, cytokinins, a group of phytohormones derived from adenine, stimulate cell proliferation. Cytokinin signaling is initiated by membrane-associated histidine kinase receptors and transduced through a phosphorelay system. We show that in the
              Arabidopsis
              shoot apical meristem ({SAM}), cytokinin regulates cell division by promoting nuclear shuttling of Myb-domain protein 3R4 ({MYB}3R4), a transcription factor that activates mitotic gene expression. Newly synthesized {MYB}3R4 protein resides predominantly in the cytoplasm. At the G2-to-M transition, rapid nuclear accumulation of {MYB}3R4—consistent with an associated transient peak in cytokinin concentration—feeds a positive feedback loop involving importins and initiates a transcriptional cascade that drives mitosis and cytokinesis. An engineered nuclear-restricted {MYB}3R4 mimics the cytokinin effects of enhanced cell proliferation and meristem growth.},

	abstract = {Plants have an amazing ability to adapt to their environment, and this extends beyond biochemical responses and includes developmental changes that help them better exploit resources and survive. The plasticity observed in individual plant morphology is associated with robust developmental pathways that are influenced by environmental factors. However, there is still much to learn about the mechanisms behind the formation of the root system. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the root system displays a hierarchical structure with primary and secondary roots. The process of lateral root ({LR}) organogenesis involves multiple steps, including {LR} pre-patterning, {LR} initiation, {LR} outgrowth, and {LR} emergence. The study of root developmental plasticity in Arabidopsis has led to significant progress in understanding the mechanisms governing lateral root formation. The importance of root system architecture lies in its ability to shape the distribution of roots in the soil, which affects the plant’s ability to acquire nutrients and water. In Arabidopsis, lateral roots originate from pericycle cells adjacent to the xylem poles known as the xylem-pole-pericycle ({XPP}). The positioning of {LRs} along the primary root is underpinned by a repetitive pre-patterning mechanism that establishes primed sites for future lateral root formation. In a subset of primed cells, the memory of a transient priming stimulus leads to the formation of stable pre-branch sites and the establishment of founder cell identity. These founder cells undergo a series of highly organized periclinal and anticlinal cell divisions and expansion to form lateral root primordia. Subsequently, {LRP} emerges through three overlying cell layers of the primary root, giving rise to fully developed {LRs}. In addition to {LRs} Arabidopsis can also develop adventitious lateral roots from the primary root in response to specific stress signals such as wounding or environmental cues. Overall, this review creates an overview of the mechanisms governing root lateral root formation which can be a stepping stone to improved crop yields and a better understanding of plant adaptation to changing environments.},

Biochemical analysis showed that {AtFH}8({FH}1FH2) could form dimers and bundle preformed actin ﬁlaments or induce stellar structures during actin polymerization. Expression of truncated forms of {AtFH}8 and immunolocalization analysis showed that {AtFH}8 localized primarily to nuclear envelope in interphase and to the new cell wall after cytokinesis, depending primarily on its N-terminal transmembrane domain. {GUS} histochemical staining showed {AtFH}8 was predominantly expressed in Arabidopsis root meristem, vasculature, and outgrowth points of lateral roots. The primary root growth and lateral root initiation of atfh8 could be decreased by latrunculin B ({LatB}). Analysis of the number of dividing cells in Arabidopsis root tips showed that much fewer dividing cells in Lat B-treated atfh8 plants than wild-type plants, which indicates that {AtFH}8 was involved in cell division. Actin cytoskeleton in root meristem of atfh8-1 was more sensitive to {LatB} treatment than that of wild-type. Altogether, our results indicate that {AtFH}8 is an actin ﬁlament nucleator and bundler that functions in cell division and root development.},

We suggest that synchronous bursts of cell death in lateral root cap cells release pulses of auxin to surrounding root tissues, establishing the pattern for lateral root formation.

Using the Arabidopsis root as a model, we show that while {LR} formation is the main auxin-induced program after de-etiolation, plants with age become competent to form a periderm in response to auxin. The establishment of the vascular cambium acts as the developmental switch required to trigger auxin-mediated periderm initiation. Moreover, distinct auxin signaling components and targets control {LR} versus periderm formation. Among the periderm-speciﬁc-promoting transcription factors, {WUSCHEL}-{RELATED} {HOMEOBOX} 4 ({WOX}4) and {KNAT}1/{BREVIPEDICELLUS} ({BP}) stand out as their speciﬁc overexpression in the periderm results in an increased number of periderm layers, a trait of agronomical importance in breeding programs targeting stress tolerance.

Here, we reveal that degradation of lariat intronic {RNAs} ({lariRNAs}) modulated by {SICKLE} ({SIC}) is required for {LR} development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Loss of {SIC} results in hyper-accumulation of {lariRNAs} and restricts the outgrowth of {LR} primordia, thereby reducing the number of emerged {LRs}. Decreasing accumulation of {lariRNAs} by over-expressing {RNA} debranching enzyme 1 ({DBR}1), a rate-limiting enzyme of {lariRNA} decay, restored {LR} defects in {SIC}-deﬁcient plants. Mechanistically, {SIC} interacts with {DBR}1 and facilitates its nuclear accumulation, which is achieved through two functionally redundant regions ({SIC}1–244 and {SIC}252–319) for nuclear localization. Of the remaining amino acids in this region, six ({SIC}245–251) comprise a {DBR}1interacting region while two ({SICM}246 and {SICW}251) are essential for {DBR}1–{SIC} interaction. Reducing {lariRNAs} restored {microRNA} ({miRNA}) levels and {LR} development in {lariRNA} hyper-accumulating plants, suggesting that these well-known regulators of {LR} development mainly function downstream of {lariRNAs}. Taken together, we propose that {SIC} acts as an enhancer of {DBR}1 nuclear accumulation by driving nuclear localization through direct interaction, thereby promoting {lariRNA} decay to ﬁne-tune {miRNA} biogenesis and modulating {LR} development.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          At the basis of plant developmental plasticity are continuously active pluripotent stem cells, which fuel the life-long post-embryonic formation of new organs. Since plant cells are encased in cell walls and thus immotile, their individual fate-specification program is dependent on their relative position within the organism. It is assumed that the cell wall and its mechanical properties are under surveillance, linking cell wall state to intracellular gene-regulatory networks. However, the role of these cell wall signalling pathways in plant development and the contribution of cell wall properties to cell behaviour and identity are unclear. Here, we show that control of cell wall properties is essential for the perpetuation of stem cell populations and pattering in the shoot apical meristems. The expression of pectin methylesterases ({PMEs}), which modify homogalacturonan methylesterification and thereby modulate cell wall mechanics, is maintained at low levels in stem cells by the stem cell specifying transcription factor {WUS}. Low {PME} expression is required for stemness, auxin patterning and stem cell-specific mechanical properties. Conversely, {WUS} depletion reduces wall stiffness in the meristem centre, reinforcing its role in maintaining mechanical homeostasis. Together, our findings show that {WUS}-mediated control of cell wall-modifying enzymes is essential for sustaining stem cell identity and {SAM} organization. These results demonstrat that the plant cell wall is not only involved in cell differentiation, but also exerts feedback control on developmental transitions, contributing to our understanding how the immediate physical environment is able to guide cell fate decisions in plants.},

	abstract = {Molecular cloning is a crucial technique in genetic engineering that enables the precise design of synthetic transcriptional units ({TUs}) and the manipulation of genomes. {GreenGate} and several other modular molecular cloning systems were developed about ten years ago and are widely used in plant research. All these systems define grammars for assembling transcriptional units from building blocks, cloned as Level 0 modules flanked by four-base pair overhangs and recognition sites for a particular Type {IIs} endonuclease. Modules are efficiently assembled into Level 1 {TUs} in a hierarchical assembly process, and Level 2 multigene constructs are assembled by stacking Level 1 {TUs}. {GreenGate} is highly popular but has three main limitations. First, using ad-hoc overhangs added by {PCR} and classical restriction/ligation prevents the efficient use of a one-pot, one-step reaction to generate entry clones and domesticate internal sites; second, a Level 1 {TU} is assembled from a maximum of six modules, which may be limiting for applications such as multiplex genome editing; third, the generation of Level 2 assemblies is sequential and inefficient. {GreenGate} 2.0 ({GG}2.0) expands {GreenGate} features. It introduces additional overhangs, allowing for the combination of up to 12 Level 0 modules in a Level 1 {TU}. It includes a Universal Entry Generator plasmid ({pUEG}) to streamline the generation of Level 0 modules. {GG}2.0 introduces {GreenBraid}, a convenient method for stacking transcriptional units iteratively for multigene assemblies. Importantly, {GG}2.0 is backwards compatible with most existing {GreenGate} modules. Additionally, {GG}2.0 includes Level 0 modules for multiplex expression of guide {RNAs} for {CRISPR}/Cas9 genome editing and pre-assembled Level 1 vectors for dexamethasone-inducible gene expression and ubiquitous expression of plasma membrane and nuclear fluorescent markers. {GG}2.0 streamlines and increases the versatility of assembling complex transcriptional units and their combination.},

It is one of the few derived traits specific to embryophytes, in which it is involved in the spatial control of cell division. Here we show that loss of function of Physcomitrella patens {PpTON}1 strongly affects development of the moss gametophore, phenocopying the developmental syndrome observed in Arabidopsis ton1 mutants: mutant leafy shoots display random orientation of cell division and severe defects in cell elongation, which are correlated with absence of {PPB} formation and disorganization of the cortical microtubule array in interphase cells. In hypomorphic Ppton1 alleles, {PPB} are still formed, whereas elongation defects are observed, showing the dual function of {TON}1 in organizing cortical arrays of microtubules during both interphase and premitosis. Ppton1 mutation has no impact on development of the protonema, which is consistent with the documented absence of {PPB} formation at this stage, apart from alteration of the gravitropic response, uncovering a new function of {TON}1 proteins in plants. Successful reciprocal crosscomplementation between Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis shows conservation of {TON}1 function during land plant evolution. These results establish the essential role of the {PPB} in division plane specification in a basal land plant lineage, and provide new information on the function of {TON}1.

              Despite the growing interest in using chemical genetics in plant research, small molecule target identification remains a major challenge. The cellular thermal shift assay coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry ({CETSA} {MS}) that monitors changes in the thermal stability of proteins caused by their interactions with small molecules, other proteins, or posttranslational modifications, allows the discovery of drug targets or the study of protein–metabolite and protein–protein interactions mainly in mammalian cells. To showcase the applicability of this method in plants, we applied {CETSA} {MS} to intact
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              cells and identified the thermal proteome of the plant-specific glycogen synthase kinase 3 ({GSK}3) inhibitor, bikinin. A comparison between the thermal and the phosphoproteomes of bikinin revealed the auxin efflux carrier {PIN}-{FORMED}1 ({PIN}1) as a substrate of the

              Properly patterned deposition of cell wall polymers is prerequisite for the morphogenesis of plant cells. A cortical microtubule array guides the two-dimensional pattern of cell wall deposition. Yet, the mechanism underlying the three-dimensional patterning of cell wall deposition is poorly understood. In metaxylem vessels, cell wall arches are formed over numerous pit membranes, forming highly organized three-dimensional cell wall structures. Here, we show that the microtubule-associated proteins, {MAP}70-5 and {MAP}70-1, regulate arch development. The
              map70-1 map70-5
              plants formed oblique arches in an abnormal orientation in pits. Microtubules fit the aperture of developing arches in wild-type cells, whereas microtubules in

              cells extended over the boundaries of pit arches. {MAP}70 caused the bending and bundling of microtubules. These results suggest that {MAP}70 confines microtubules within the pit apertures by altering the physical properties of microtubules, thereby directing the growth of pit arches in the proper orientation. This study provides clues to understanding how plants develop three-dimensional structure of cell walls.},

The thickenings form characteristic patterns (e.g., spiral and pitted) that depend upon the bundling of underlying microtubules [1, 2]. To identify microtubule-associated proteins ({MAPs}) involved in patterning microtubules, we optimized an in vitro system for triggering single Arabidopsis cells to differentiate synchronously into {TEs}. From more than 200 microtubule-implicated proteins, {AtMAP}70-5 was the only {MAP} upregulated upon, and speciﬁc to, {TE} differentiation.

Manipulating levels of {AtMAP}70-5 and its binding partner {AtMAP}70-1 by overexpression or {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) silencing shifted the balance between the characteristic patterns. {RNAi} silencing produced stunted plants with disorganized vascular bundles. In culture, {RNAi} knockdown caused ribs of secondary cell wall, surrounded by microtubules, to invaginate and fall into the cytoplasm.

            Lateral root formation in plants can be studied as the process of interaction between chemical signals and physical forces during development. Lateral root primordia grow through overlying cell layers that must accommodate this incursion. Here, we analyze responses of the endodermis, the immediate neighbor to an initiating lateral root. Endodermal cells overlying lateral root primordia lose volume, change shape, and relinquish their tight junction–like diffusion barrier to make way for the emerging lateral root primordium. Endodermal feedback is absolutely required for initiation and growth of lateral roots, and we provide evidence that this is mediated by controlled volume loss in the endodermis. We propose that turgidity and rigid cell walls, typical of plants, impose constraints that are specifically modified for a given developmental process.},

              Plant‐parasitic nematodes cause devastating agricultural damage worldwide. Only a few synthetic nematicides can be used and their application is limited in fields. Therefore, there is a need for sustainable and environment‐friendly alternatives. Nematode‐trapping fungi ({NTF}) are natural predators of nematodes. They capture and digest them with their hyphae and are starting to being used as bio‐control agents. In this study, we applied the {NTF}

              Ficus carica
              , an alternative host plant for
              X. index
              , significantly. Sodium‐alginate pellets with
              A. flagrans
              spores were produced for vineyard soil inoculation under laboratory conditions. The {NTF}

              Phosphate is a key resource for plants, and remediating phosphate deficiency drives considerable fertilizer use. In low-phosphate conditions, roots make more root hairs, which makes them better able to take up what little phosphate can be found. Wendrich

            Single-cell transcriptomics uncovers a hormone signaling pathway that drives development of root hairs in search of phosphate.
          , 
            
              {INTRODUCTION}
              In plants, vascular tissues serve a dual function by providing both structural support and transport of water, nutrients, hormones, and other signaling molecules throughout the plant body. Proliferation of vascular tissues is, in part, controlled by the {TARGET} {OF} {MONOPTEROS} 5/{LONESOME} {HIGHWAY} ({TMO}5/{LHW}) transcription factor complex and involves intricate cell communication through mobile factors. The activity of this heterodimer complex is limited to young xylem cells and is required and sufficient to control vascular cell proliferation by inducing expression of rate-limiting enzymes in the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway. Because cytokinin is mobile, the molecular and developmental responses to this hormone signaling cascade are likely to have an effect in various cell types surrounding the xylem and perhaps even outside the vascular bundle. To what extent this is the case and how this controls developmental processes other than vascular proliferation remain unknown.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              
                By intersecting a high-resolution single-cell gene expression atlas with {TMO}5/{LHW} target genes, we probed the tissue-specific distribution of transcriptional responses upon induction of this transcription factor complex in the
                Arabidopsis
                root meristem. We next used a combination of genetic and molecular tools to validate the existence and importance of a cytokinin-dependent signaling mechanism bridging the inner vascular tissues and the outer epidermis cell layers.
              
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              
                We generated a single-cell gene expression atlas that represents all known cell types and sub–cell types of the
                Arabidopsis
                root apical meristem. Cell-type annotations and developmental trajectories were validated through expression of known marker genes, newly generated promoter reporter lines, and analysis of the endoreduplication status in each cell cluster. We next intersected this expression atlas with a set of known target genes of the vascular {TMO}5/{LHW} transcription factor complex and found that a large portion of the target genes are expressed in, and are even restricted to, the outermost root hair cells. This suggests a possible involvement of the {TMO}5/{LHW} complex in root hair development. In line with this hypothesis, misexpression of {TMO}5 and {LHW} in the entire root meristem was found to increase root hair density, a phenotype resembling wild-type roots grown under phosphate-limiting conditions. Moreover, the response of epidermal cells to phosphate deficit was shown to be {TMO}5-dependent. Phosphate-limiting conditions were found to induce
                {TMO}5
                expression, and genetically increasing
                {TMO}5
                expression only in the vascular bundle is sufficient to trigger epidermal responses. These results indicate that the {TMO}5-dependent increase in root hair density under low-phosphate conditions occurs through a cell nonautonomous effect.
              
              {TMO}5/{LHW}-dependent vascular cytokinin biosynthesis was found to be sufficient to increase epidermal root hair density because mutants with reduced cytokinin levels are less sensitive to the effects of phosphate-limiting conditions on root hair density. Furthermore, phosphate-limiting conditions increase cytokinin signaling in epidermal cells of wild-type roots, and treatment with exogenous cytokinin can restore root hair densities back to wild-type levels in the absence of {TMO}5 activity. This suggests that cytokinin is the mobile signal linking {TMO}5/{LHW} activity in vascular cells to root hair density changes in response to phosphate deficit. The {TMO}5 and cytokinin-dependent root hair density increase under low-phosphate conditions was found to originate not only from changes in epidermal cell length but also from changes in cell identity because both phosphate-limiting conditions and exogenous cytokinin treatment were shown to scramble identities of the otherwise highly organized epidermal cells.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              Through its effect on cytokinin biosynthesis, the vascular {TMO}5/{LHW} heterodimer complex controls epidermal root hair density by modifying cell length and cell identity. We hypothesize that phosphate-limiting conditions may trigger increased auxin signaling in xylem cells, inducing activity of the {TMO}5/{LHW} pathway and downstream local cytokinin biosynthesis. Cytokinin may then diffuse outward from the vasculature to direct both length and fate of the outer trichoblast cells. This hormone signaling cascade spans multiple tissue layers, allowing roots to efficiently forage the soil for phosphate.

              Optimal plant growth is hampered by deficiency of the essential macronutrient phosphate in most soils. Plant roots can, however, increase their root hair density to efficiently forage the soil for this immobile nutrient. By generating and exploiting a high-resolution single-cell gene expression atlas of
              Arabidopsis
              roots, we show an enrichment of {TARGET} {OF} {MONOPTEROS} 5/{LONESOME} {HIGHWAY} ({TMO}5/{LHW}) target gene responses in root hair cells. The {TMO}5/{LHW} heterodimer triggers biosynthesis of mobile cytokinin in vascular cells and increases root hair density during low-phosphate conditions by modifying both the length and cell fate of epidermal cells. Moreover, root hair responses in phosphate-deprived conditions are {TMO}5- and cytokinin-dependent. Cytokinin signaling links root hair responses in the epidermis to perception of phosphate depletion in vascular cells.},

In addition, studies are beginning to identify direct targets of the auxin-responsive transcription factors that underlie auxin modulation of development. Mechanisms to tune the response to different auxin levels are emerging, as are ﬁrst insights into how this single hormone can trigger diverse responses. Key unanswered questions center on the mechanism for auxin-directed transcriptional repression and the identity of additional determinants of auxin response speciﬁcity.

	abstract = {Essential genes, estimated at approximately 20\% of the Arabidopsis genome, are broadly expressed and required for reproductive success. They are difficult to study, as interfering with their function leads to premature death. Transcription is one of the essential functions of life, and the multi-protein Mediator complex coordinates the regulation of gene expression at nearly every eukaryotic promoter. In this study, we focused on a core Mediator component called {MEDIATOR}21 ({MED}21), which is required for activation of transcription. Our previous work has also shown a role for {MED}21 in repression of gene expression through its interaction with a corepressor protein. Here, we sought to differentiate the role {MED}21 plays in activation versus repression using the model plant Arabidopsis. As mutations in {MED}21 lead to embryo lethal phenotypes, we constructed a set of synthetic switches using {PhiC}31 serine integrases to create an “on-to-off” inducible loss of function {MED}21 in a non-essential tissue. Our technology, which we call Integrase Erasers, made it possible for med21 mutant plants to survive into adulthood by ablating protein expression selectively in lateral root primordia, allowing quantification and characterization of med21 mutant phenotypes in a post-embryonic context. In addition, we engineered chemical induction of the Integrase Eraser to ablate {MED}21 expression in whole seedlings at a userspecified timepoint. Finally, we extended this technology to build a hot swappable Integrase Isoform Switch where expression of the integrase toggled cells from expressing wildtype {MED}21 to expressing {MED}21 sequence variants. Our analysis of the entire set of new integrase-based tools demonstrates that this is a highly efficient and robust approach to the study of essential genes.},

It is unknown whether this robust post-embryonic organ formation results from stereotypic dynamic processes, in which the arrangement of cells follows rigid rules. Here, we combine modeling with empirical observations of whole-organ development to identify the principles governing lateral root formation in Arabidopsis. Lateral roots derive from a small pool of founder cells in which some take a dominant role as seen by lineage tracing. The ﬁrst division of the founders is asymmetric, tightly regulated, and determines the formation of a layered structure. Whereas the pattern of subsequent cell divisions is not stereotypic between different samples, it is characterized by a regular switch in division plane orientation. This switch is also necessary for the appearance of patterned layers as a result of the apical growth of the primordium. Our data suggest that lateral root morphogenesis is based on a limited set of rules. They determine cell growth and division orientation. The organ-level coupling of the cell behavior ensures the emergence of the lateral root’s characteristic features. We propose that self-organizing, non-deterministic modes of development account for the robustness of plant organ morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Auxin efflux through plasma-membrane-integral {PIN}-{FORMED} ({PIN}) carriers is essential for plant tissue organization and tightly regulated. For instance, a molecular rheostat critically controls {PIN}-mediated auxin transport in developing protophloem sieve elements of
              Arabidopsis
              roots. Plasma-membrane-association of the rheostat proteins, {BREVIS} {RADIX} ({BRX}) and {PROTEIN} {KINASE} {ASSOCIATED} {WITH} {BRX} ({PAX}), is reinforced by interaction with {PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL}-4-{PHOSPHATE}-5-{KINASE} ({PIP}5K). Genetic evidence suggests that {BRX} dampens autocrine signaling of {CLAVATA}3/{EMBRYO} {SURROUNDING} {REGION}-{RELATED} 45 ({CLE}45) peptide via its receptor {BARELY} {ANY} {MERISTEM} 3 ({BAM}3). How excess {CLE}45-{BAM}3 signaling interferes with protophloem development and whether it does so directly or indirectly remains unclear. Here we show that rheostat polarity is independent of {PIN} polarity, but interdependent with {PIP}5K. Catalytically inactive {PIP}5K confers rheostat polarity without reinforcing its localization, revealing a possible {PIP}5K scaffolding function. Moreover, {PIP}5K and {PAX} cooperatively control local {PIN} abundance. We further find that {CLE}45-{BAM}3 signaling branches via {RLCK}-{VII}/{PBS}1-{LIKE} ({PBL}) cytoplasmic kinases to destabilize rheostat localization. Our data thus reveal antagonism between {CLE}45-{BAM}3-{PBL} signaling and {PIP}5K that converges on auxin efflux regulation through dynamic control of {PAX} polarity. Because second-site
              bam3
              mutation suppresses root as well as shoot phenotypes of
              pip5k

In sites of lateral root primordia emergence, both esterified and de-esterified pectin variants are differentially distributed. Using a reverse-genetics approach, we show that genes controlling pectin esterification regulate the root clock and lateral root initiation. These results indicate that the balance between esterified and de-esterified pectin states is essential for proper root clock function and the subsequent initiation of lateral root primordia.},

This has given rise to unique mechanisms to control organ formation compared to metazoans. The fascinating interplay between forces and local cellular reorganization is still poorly understood. Growth of lateral roots is a prominent example of a developmental process in which mechanical forces between neighboring cells are generated and must be dealt with. Lateral roots initiate from a single cell layer that resides deep within the primary root. On their way out, lateral roots grow through the overlying endodermal, cortical, and epidermal cell layers. It was recently demonstrated that endodermal cells actively accommodate lateral root formation. Interfering genetically with these accommodating responses in the endodermis completely blocks cell proliferation in the pericycle. The lateral root system provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby mechanical forces and intercellular communication regulate spatial accommodation during plant development.},

Degradation signals (degrons) that are targeted by the N-end rule pathway include a set called N-degrons. The main determinant of an N-degron is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein. In eukaryotes, the N-end rule pathway is a part of the ubiquitin system and consists of two branches, the Ac/N-end rule and the Arg/N-end rule pathways. The Ac/N-end rule pathway targets proteins containing Na-terminally acetylated (Nt-acetylated) residues. The Arg/Nend rule pathway recognizes unacetylated N-terminal residues and involves N-terminal arginylation. Together, these branches target for degradation a majority of cellular proteins. For example, more than 80\% of human proteins are cotranslationally Nt-acetylated. Thus, most proteins harbor a specific degradation signal, termed {AcN}-degron, from the moment of their birth. Specific N-end rule pathways are also present in prokaryotes and in mitochondria. Enzymes that produce N-degrons include methionine-aminopeptidases, caspases, calpains, Nt-acetylases, Ntamidases, arginyl-transferases, and leucyl-transferases. Regulated degradation of specific proteins by the N-end rule pathway mediates a legion of physiological functions, including the sensing of heme, oxygen, and nitric oxide; selective elimination of misfolded proteins; the regulation of {DNA} repair, segregation, and condensation; the signaling by G proteins; the regulation of peptide import, fat metabolism, viral and bacterial infections, apoptosis, meiosis, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiovascular development; and the functioning of adult organs, including the pancreas and the brain.

	abstract = {Background: Multiplex {CRISPR}-Cas9-based genome editing is an efficient method for targeted disruption of gene function in plants. Use of {CRISPR}-Cas9 has increased rapidly in recent years and is becoming a routine method for generating single and higher order Arabidopsis thaliana mutants. Low entry, reliable assembly of {CRISPR}/Cas9 vectors and efficient mutagenesis is necessary to enable a maximum of researchers to break through the genetic redundancy within plant multi-gene families and allow for a plethora of gene function studies that have been previously unachievable. It will also allow routine de novo generation of mutations in ever more complex genetic backgrounds that make introgression of pre-existing alleles highly cumbersome.
Results: To facilitate rapid and efficient use of {CRISPR}/Cas9 for Arabidopsis research, we developed a {CRISPR}/Cas9based toolbox for generating mutations at multiple genomic loci, using two-color fluorescent seed selection. In our system, up-to eight {gRNAs} can be routinely introduced into a binary vector carrying either a {FastRed}, {FastGreen} or {FastCyan} fluorescent seed selection cassette. {FastRed} and {FastGreen} binary vectors can be co-transformed as a cocktail via floral dip to introduce sixteen {gRNAs} at the same time. The seeds can be screened either for red or green fluorescence, or for the presence of both colors. Importantly, in the second generation after transformation, Cas9 free plants are identified simply by screening the non-fluorescent seeds. Our collection of binary vectors allows to choose between two widely-used promoters to drive Cas enzymes, either the egg cell-specific ({pEC}1.2) from A. thaliana or the constitutive promoter from Petroselinum crispum ({PcUBi}4-2). Available enzymes are “classical” Cas9 codon-optimized for A. thaliana and a recently reported, intron-containing version of Cas9 codon-optimized for Zea mays, {zCas}9i. We observed the highest efficiency in producing knockout phenotypes by using intron-containing {zCas}9i driven under egg-cell specific {pEC}1.2 promoter. Finally, we introduced convenient restriction sites flanking promoter, Cas9 and fluorescent selection cassette in some of the T-{DNA} vectors, thus allowing straightforward swapping of all three elements for further adaptation and improvement of the system.
Conclusion: A rapid, simple and flexible {CISPR}/Cas9 cloning system was established that allows assembly of multiguide {RNA} constructs in a robust and reproducible fashion, by avoiding generation of very big constructs. The system enables a flexible, fast and efficient screening of single or higher order A. thaliana mutants.},

Genes involved in several aspects of cytokinin transport have been characterized; however, much of the elaborate system remains elusive. In this study, we used a transient expression system in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves to screen Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transporter genes and isolated {ATP}-{BINDING} {CASSETTE} {TRANSPORTER} C4 ({ABCC}4). Validation through drug-induced expression in Arabidopsis and heterologous expression in budding yeast revealed that {ABCC}4 effluxes the active form of cytokinins. During the seedling stage, {ABCC}4 was highly expressed in roots, and its expression was upregulated in response to cytokinin application. Loss-of-function mutants of {ABCC}4 displayed enhanced primary root elongation, similar to mutants impaired in cytokinin biosynthesis or signaling, that was suppressed by exogenous trans-zeatin treatment. In contrast, overexpression of the gene led to suppression of root elongation. These results suggest that {ABCC}4 plays a role in the efflux of active cytokinin, thereby contributing to root growth regulation. Additionally, cytokinin-dependent enlargement of stomatal aperture was impaired in the loss-of-function and overexpression lines. Our findings contribute to unraveling the many complexities of cytokinin flow and enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying root system development and stomatal opening in plants.},

	abstract = {Plants produce organs of various shapes and sizes. While much has been learned about genetic regulation of organogenesis, the integration of mechanics in the process is also gaining attention. Here, we consider the role of forces as instructive signals in organ morphogenesis. Turgor pressure is the primary cause of mechanical signals in developing organs. Because plant cells are glued to each other, mechanical signals act, in essence, at multiple scales, through cell wall contiguity and water ﬂux. In turn, cells use such signals to resist mechanical stress, for instance, by reinforcing their cell walls. We show that the three elemental shapes behind plant organs — spheres, cylinders and lamina — can be actively maintained by such a mechanical feedback. Combinations of this 3-letter alphabet can generate more complex shapes. Furthermore, mechanical conﬂicts emerge at the boundary between domains exhibiting different growth rates or directions. These secondary mechanical signals contribute to three other organ shape features — folds, shape reproducibility and growth arrest. The further integration of mechanical signals with the molecular network offers many fruitful prospects for the scientiﬁc community, including the role of proprioception in organ shape robustness or the deﬁnition of cell and organ identities as a result of an interplay between biochemical and mechanical signals.},

            A single plant can produce from hundreds to millions of lateral roots ({LRs}), which facilitate water and mineral uptake and transport. {LRs} originate in a tissue called the pericycle, but the underlying mechanism is obscure. With the aid of clonal analysis, we deduced that {LR} initiation begins with a single pericycle founder cell ({FC}) which then recruits the neighboring pericycle cells to become {FCs}. A time-lapse analysis validated this conclusion and also showed that {FC} recruitment is an auxin-dependent and gradual process that takes place in an unpredictable pattern. Thus, {LR} initiation is not a one-step process, as previously considered.
          , 
            The reiterative process of lateral root ({LR}) formation is widespread and underlies root system formation. However, early {LR} primordium ({LRP}) morphogenesis is not fully understood. In this study, we conducted both a clonal analysis and time-lapse experiments to decipher the pattern and sequence of pericycle founder cell ({FC}) participation in {LR} formation. Most commonly, {LRP} initiation starts with the specification of just one {FC} longitudinally. Clonal and anatomical analyses suggested that a single {FC} gradually recruits neighboring pericycle cells to become {FCs}. This conclusion was validated by long-term time-lapse live-imaging experiments. Once the first {FC} starts to divide, its immediate neighbors, both lengthwise and laterally, are recruited within the hour, after which they recruit their neighboring cells within a few hours. Therefore, {LRP} initiation is a gradual, multistep process. {FC} recruitment is auxin-dependent and is abolished by treatment with a polar auxin transport inhibitor. Furthermore, {FC} recruitment establishes a morphogenetic field where laterally peripheral cells have a lower auxin response, which is associated with a lower proliferation potential, compared to centrally located {FCs}. The lateral boundaries of the morphogenetic field are determined by phloem-adjacent pericycle cells, which are the last cells to be recruited as {FCs}. The proliferation potential of these cells is limited, but their recruitment is essential for root system formation, resulting in the formation of a new vascular connection between the nascent and parent root, which is crucial for establishing a continuous and efficient vascular system.},

              Lateral roots ({LRs}) are critical to root system architecture development in plants. Although the molecular mechanisms by which auxin regulates {LR} development have been extensively studied, several additional regulatory systems are hypothesized to be involved. Recently, the regulatory role of very long chain fatty acids ({VLCFAs}) has been shown in {LR} development. Our analysis showed that {LTPG}1 and {LTPG}2, transporters of {VLCFAs}, are specifically expressed in the developing {LR} primordium ({LRP}), while the number of {LRs} is reduced in the
              ltpg1
              /
              ltpg2
              double mutant. Moreover, late {LRP} development was hindered when the {VLCFA} levels were reduced by the {VLCFA} synthesis enzyme mutant,
              kcs1‐5
              . However, the details of the regulatory mechanisms of {LR} development controlled by {VLCFAs} remain unknown. In this study, we propose a novel method to analyze the {LRP} development stages with high temporal resolution using a deep neural network and identify a {VLCFA}‐responsive transcription factor, {MYB}93, via transcriptome analysis of
              kcs1‐5
              . {MYB}93 showed a carbon chain length‐specific expression response following treatment of {VLCFAs}. Furthermore,
              myb93
              transcriptome analysis suggested that
              {MYB}93
              regulated the expression of cell wall organization genes. In addition, we also found that {LTPG}1 and {LTPG}2 are involved in {LR} development through the formation of root cap cuticle, which is different from transcriptional regulation by {VLCFAs}. Our results suggest that {VLCFA} is a regulator of {LRP} development through transcription factor‐mediated regulation of gene expression and the transportation of {VLCFAs} is also involved in {LR} development through root cap cuticle formation.

            Significance Statement
            
              Very long chain fatty acids ({VLCFAs}) may regulate lateral root development; however, the molecular mechanism by which {VLCFAs} influence lateral root development remains unclarified. In the present study, we show that the expression levels of
              {MYB}93
              are altered by {VLCFAs} in
              Arabidopsis

	abstract = {Lateral roots are crucial for plant growth and development, making them an important target for research aiming to improve crop yields and food security. However, their endogenous ontogeny and, as it were, stochastic appearance challenge their study. Lateral Root Inducible Systems ({LRIS}) can be used to overcome these challenges by inducing lateral roots massively and synchronously. The combination of {LRISs} with transcriptomic approaches signiﬁcantly advanced our insights in the molecular control of lateral root formation, in particular for Arabidopsis. Despite this success, {LRISs} have been underutilized for other plant species or for lateral root developmental stages later than the initiation. In this study, we developed and/or adapted {LRISs} in rice, Medicago, and Arabidopsis to perform {RNA}-sequencing during time courses that cover different developmental stages of lateral root formation and primordium development. As such, our study provides three extensive datasets of gene expression proﬁles during lateral root development in three different plant species. The three {LRISs} are highly effective but timing and spatial distribution of lateral root induction vary among the species. Detailed characterization of the stages in time and space in the respective species enabled an interspecies co-expression analysis to identify conserved players involved in lateral root development, as illustrated for the {AUX}/{IAA} and {LBD} gene families. Overall, our results provide a valuable resource to identify potentially conserved regulatory mechanisms in lateral root development, and as such will contribute to a better understanding of the complex regulatory network underlying lateral root development.},

              Arabidopsis possesses approximately 2000 transcription factors ({TFs}) in its genome. They play pivotal roles in various biological processes but analysis of their function has been hampered by the overlapping nature of their activities. To uncover clues to their function, we generated inducible {TF} lines using glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}) fusion techniques in Arabidopsis. These {TF}‐{GR} lines each express one of 1255 {TFs} as a fusion with the {GR} gene. An average 14 lines of T
              2
              transgenic {TF}‐{GR} lines were generated for each {TF} to monitor their function. To evaluate these transcription lines, we induced the {TF}‐{GR} lines of phytochrome‐interacting factor 4, which controls photomorphogenesis, with synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. These phytochrome‐interacting factor 4‐{GR} lines showed the phenotype described in a previous report. We performed screening of the other {TF}‐{GR} lines for {TFs} involved in light signaling under blue and far‐red light conditions and identified 13 novel {TF} candidates. Among these, we found two lines showing higher anthocyanin accumulation under light conditions and we examined the regulating genes. These results indicate that the {TF}‐{GR} lines can be used to dissect functionally redundant genes in plants and demonstrate that the {TF}‐{GR} line collection can be used as an effective tool for functional analysis of {TFs}.

The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes seven {CKX} proteins which differ in subcellular localization and substrate speciﬁcity. Here we analyze the {CKX}7 gene, which to the best of our knowledge has not yet been studied. {pCKX}7:{GUS} expression was detected in the vasculature, the transmitting tissue and the mature embryo sac. A {CKX}7–{GFP} fusion protein localized to the cytosol, which is unique among all {CKX} family members. 35S:{CKX}7-expressing plants developed short, early terminating primary roots with smaller apical meristems, contrasting with plants overexpressing other {CKX} genes. The vascular bundles of 35S:{CKX}7 primary roots contained only protoxylem elements, thus resembling the wol mutant of the {CRE}1/{AHK}4 receptor gene. We show that {CRE}1/{AHK}4 activity is required to establish the {CKX}7 overexpression phenotype. Several cytokinin metabolites, in particular cis-zeatin ({cZ}) and N-glucoside cytokinins, were depleted stronger in 35S:{CKX}7 plants compared with plants overexpressing other {CKX} genes. Interestingly, enhanced protoxylem formation together with reduced primary root growth was also found in the {cZ}-deﬁcient {tRNA} isopentenyltransferase mutant ipt2,9. However, different cytokinins were similarly efﬁcient in suppressing 35S:{CKX}7 and ipt2,9 vascular phenotypes. Therefore, we hypothesize that the pool of cytosolic cytokinins is particularly relevant in the root procambium where it mediates the differentiation of vascular tissues through {CRE}1/{AHK}4. Taken together, the distinct consequences of {CKX}7 overexpression indicate that the cellular compartmentalization of cytokinin degradation and substrate preference of {CKX} isoforms are relevant parameters that deﬁne the activities of the hormone.},

We used a microarray-based approach to find regulators of the auxin-induced {PIN} relocation in Arabidopsis thaliana root, and identified a subset of a family of phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins ({PITPs}), the {PATELLINs} ({PATLs}). Here, we show that {PATLs} are expressed in partially overlapping cell types in different tissues going through mitosis or initiating differentiation programs. {PATLs} are plasma membraneassociated proteins accumulated in Arabidopsis embryos, primary roots, lateral root primordia and developing stomata. Higher order patl mutants display reduced {PIN}1 repolarization in response to auxin, shorter root apical meristem, and drastic defects in embryo and seedling development.

Since vesicle fusion generally requires coordination of vesicle tethering and subsequent fusion activity, we analyzed the subcellular localization of several subunits of the exocyst, a tethering complex active during plant cytokinesis. We found that the exocyst complex subunit Sec6 but not the Sec3 or Sec5 subunits localized to microtubule overlap regions in advance of cell plate construction in moss. Moreover, Sec6 exhibited a conserved physical interaction with an ortholog of the Sec1/Munc18 protein {KEULE}, an important regulator for cell-plate membrane vesicle fusion in Arabidopsis. Recruitment of the P. patens protein {KEULE} and vesicles to the early cell plate was delayed upon Sec6 gene silencing. Our findings, thus, suggest that vesicle-vesicle fusion is, in part, enabled by a pool of exocyst subunits at microtubule overlaps, which is recruited independently of vesicle delivery.},

	abstract = {The root system plays an essential role in plant growth and adaptation to the surrounding environment. The root clock periodically specifies lateral root prebranch sites ({PBS}), where a group of pericycle founder cells ({FC}) is primed to become {LR} founder cells ({LRFCs}) and eventually give rise to lateral root primordia ({LRP}) or lateral roots ({LRs}). This clock-driven organ formation process is tightly controlled by modulation of auxin content and signaling. Auxin perception entails the physical interaction of {TRANSPORT} {INHIBITOR} {RESPONSE} 1 ({TIR}1) or {AUXIN} {SIGNALING} F-{BOX} ({AFBs}) proteins with {AUXIN}/{INDOLE}-3-{ACETIC} {ACID} (Aux/{IAA}) repressors to form a co-receptor system. Despite the apparent simplicity, the understanding of how specific auxin co- receptors are assembled remains unclear. We identified the compound bis-methyl auxin conjugated with N-glucoside, or {BiAux}, in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that specifically induces the formation of {PBS} and the emergence of {LR}, with a slight effect on root elongation. Docking analyses indicated that {BiAux} binds to F-box proteins, and we showed that {BiAux} function depends on {TIR}1 and {AFB}2 F-box proteins and {AUXIN} {RESPONSE} {FACTOR} 7 ({ARF}7) activity, which is involved in {FC} specification and {LR} formation. Finally, using a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) heterologous expression system, we showed that {BiAux} favors the assemblage of specific co-receptors subunits involved in {LR} formation and enhances {AUXIN}/{INDOLE}-3-{ACETIC} {ACID} 28 ({IAA}28) protein degradation. These results indicate that {BiAux} acts as an allosteric modulator of specific auxin co-receptors. Therefore, {BiAux} exerts a fine-tune regulation of auxin signaling aimed to the specific formation of {LR} among the many development processes regulated by auxin..},

While herbivorous insects can often detoxify plant chemicals ingested from suitable host plants, how such detoxification affects endoparasitoids that use these herbivores as hosts is largely unknown. Here, we used transformed plants to experimentally manipulate the major detoxification reaction used by Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth) to deactivate the glucosinolate defences of its Brassicaceae host plants. We then assessed the developmental, metabolic, immune, and reproductive consequences of this genetic manipulation on the herbivore as well as its hymenopteran endoparasitoid Diadegma semiclausum. Inhibition of P. xylostella glucosinolate metabolism by plant-mediated {RNA} interference increased the accumulation of the principal glucosinolate activation products, the toxic isothiocyanates, in the herbivore, with negative effects on its growth. Although the endoparasitoid manipulated the excretion of toxins by its insect host to its own advantage, the inhibition of herbivore glucosinolate detoxification slowed endoparasitoid development, impaired its reproduction, and suppressed the expression of genes of a parasitoid-symbiotic polydnavirus that aids parasitism. Therefore, the detoxification of plant glucosinolates by an herbivore lowers its toxicity as a host and benefits the parasitoid D. semiclausum at multiple levels.},

We used this toolkit to explore the limits of multiplexing in two major model species, and report on the isolation of transgene-free octuple (83) Nicotiana benthamiana and duodecuple (123) Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines in a single generation (T1 and T2, respectively). We developed novel counter-selection markers for N. benthamiana, most importantly Sl-{FAST}2, comparable to the well-established Arabidopsis seed ﬂuorescence marker, and {FCY}-{UPP}, based on the production of toxic 5-ﬂuorouracil in the presence of a precursor. Targeting eight genes with an array of nine different {sgRNAs} and relying on {FCY}-{UPP} for selection of non-transgenic T1, we identiﬁed N. benthamiana mutant lines with astonishingly high efﬁciencies: All analyzed plants carried mutations in all genes (approximately 112/116 target sites edited). Furthermore, we targeted 12 genes by an array of 24 {sgRNAs} in A. thaliana. Efﬁciency was signiﬁcantly lower in A. thaliana, and our results indicate Cas9 availability is the limiting factor in such higher-order multiplexing applications. We identiﬁed a duodecuple mutant line by a combination of phenotypic screening and amplicon sequencing.

            Plants respond to biotic attack using an immune system of receptors to recognize molecules associated with danger. We identified an immune receptor, termed inceptin receptor ({INR}), able to confer responses to defined inceptin peptide fragments present in caterpillar oral secretions. Like many plant immune receptors, {INR} is encoded only by certain plant species but can be transferred across families to confer new signaling and defense functions. While {INR} is only found in the genomes of cowpea, common bean, and related legumes, it confers defined elicitor responses to transgenic tobacco and suppresses the growth of attacking beet armyworm larvae. {INR} expands the breadth of plant pattern recognition receptors to detection of chewing insect herbivores.
          , 
            
              Herbivory is fundamental to the regulation of both global food webs and the extent of agricultural crop losses. Induced plant responses to herbivores promote resistance and often involve the perception of specific herbivore-associated molecular patterns ({HAMPs}); however, precisely defined receptors and elicitors associated with herbivore recognition remain elusive. Here, we show that a receptor confers signaling and defense outputs in response to a defined {HAMP} common in caterpillar oral secretions ({OS}). Staple food crops, including cowpea (
              Vigna unguiculata
              ) and common bean (
              Phaseolus vulgaris
              ), specifically respond to {OS} via recognition of proteolytic fragments of chloroplastic {ATP} synthase, termed inceptins. Using forward-genetic mapping of inceptin-induced plant responses, we identified a corresponding leucine-rich repeat receptor, termed {INR}, specific to select legume species and sufficient to confer inceptin-induced responses and enhanced defense against armyworms (
              Spodoptera exigua

	abstract = {Metacaspases are part of an evolutionarily broad family of multifunctional cysteine proteases, involved in disease and normal development. Despite the extensive study of metacaspases in the two decades since their discovery, the structure-function relationship of metacaspases remains poorly understood. Furthermore, previous studies on their function have been thwarted by the redundancy in gene copy number and potential phenotypic suppression of genetic mutations, especially in plants. Here, we have solved the X-ray crystal structure of an Arabidopsis thaliana type {II} metacaspase ({AtMCA}-{IIf}) that belongs to a particular sub-group that does not require calcium ions for activation. Compared to crystal structures of other metacaspases and caspases, the {AtMCA}-{IIf} active site is structurally similar and poses a conundrum for the catalytic mechanism of the cysteine-histidine dyad. To study metacaspase activity in plants, we developed an in vitro chemical screen to identify small molecule metacaspase inhibitors. Several hits with a minimal thioxodihydropyrimidine-dione ({TDP}) structure were identified, some being specific inhibitors of {AtMCA}-{IIf}. We provide a mechanistic basis for inhibition by the {TDP}-containing compounds through molecular docking onto the {AtMCA}-{IIf} crystal structure. Finally, a {TDPcontaining} compound ({TDP}6) was effective at inhibiting lateral root emergence in vivo, likely through the inhibition of metacaspases that are specifically expressed in the endodermal cells overlaying developing lateral root primordia. In the future, the small compound inhibitors and crystal structure of {AtMCA}-{IIf} can be used to study metacaspases in various other species, such as important human pathogens including those causing neglected diseases.},

              {INTRODUCTION}
              
                Transcription factors ({TFs}) are often studied one by one or in clusters of a few related factors. However, the integration and networks of transcriptional changes to response to environmental stresses often involve many related {TFs}. In many organisms, such as plants, overlapping functions can make it difficult to understand how a biologically relevant end result can be achieved via the complex signaling networks controlled by these {TFs}. To better understand how the reference plant
                Arabidopsis
                deals with the stresses incurred by water limitation via the hormone abscisic acid ({ABA}), we characterized all {DNA} sequences that bind to the 21 {ABA}-related {TFs} in vivo.
              
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              There have been limited systematic studies of stress-responsive {TF} networks in multicellular organisms. We chose {ABA}, an essential plant hormone that is required for both development and responses to osmotic stress, as an elicitor to investigate complex gene regulatory networks under stress. Combining differential binding ({DB}) of 21 {ABA}-related {TFs} at a single time point measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ({ChIP}-seq) with differentially expressed genes from a time-series {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) data set, we analyzed the relationship between {DB} of {TFs} and differential expression ({DE}) of target genes, the determinants of {DB}, and the combinatorial effects of multi-{TF} binding. These data sets also provide a framework to construct an {ABA} {TF} network and to predict genes and cis-regulatory elements important to {ABA} responses and related environmental stresses.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              We found that, in general, {DNA} binding is correlated with transcript and protein levels of {TFs}. Most {TFs} in our study are induced by {ABA} and gain binding sites (termed “peaks”) after the hormone treatment. {ABA} also increases the binding of the {TFs} at most peaks. However, in some peaks, {TF} binding may be static or even decrease after {ABA} exposure, revealing the complexity of locus-specific gene regulation. De novo motif discovery enabled us to identify distinct, primary motifs often centrally localized in the {ChIP}-seq peaks for most {TFs}. However, it is not uncommon to find motifs, such as the G-box, that are shared by peaks from multiple {TFs} and may contribute to binding dynamics at these sites. {DB} of multiple {TFs} is a robust predictor of both the {DE} and {ABA}-related functions of the target genes. Using the {DB} and {DE} data, we constructed a network of {TFs} and canonical {ABA} pathway genes and demonstrated a regulatory hierarchy of {TFs} and extensive feedback of {ABA} responses. On the basis of a “guilt-by-association” paradigm, we further predicted genes whose functions were previously not linked to {ABA} responses, and we thus functionally characterized a new family of transcriptional regulators.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              These data sets will provide the plant community with a roadmap of {ABA}-elicited transcriptional regulation by 21 {ABA}-related {TFs}. We propose that dynamic, multi-{TF} binding could be a criterion for prioritizing the characterization of {TF} binding events, cis-regulatory elements, and functionally unknown genes in both plants and other species. In our proof-of-principle experiments, ectopic expression of the transcriptional regulators ranked highly in our model results in altered sensitivity to both {ABA} and high salinity. Together with the fact that our modeling recovered genes related to seed development and osmotic stresses, we believe such predictions are likely applicable to a broad range of developmental stages and osmotic stresses.
              
                
                  Transcriptional landscape of the {ABA} response.
                  {ABA} response pathway gene targets were identified by large-scale {ChIP}-seq and time-series {RNA}-seq experiments. A network model was built to reveal the hierarchy of {TFs} and the impact of multi-{TF} dynamic binding on gene expression. A new family of transcriptional regulators was predicted by the model and was functionally tested to evaluate the role of these regulators in osmotic stress in plants.

              Environmental stresses are universally encountered by microbes, plants, and animals. Yet systematic studies of stress-responsive transcription factor ({TF}) networks in multicellular organisms have been limited. The phytohormone abscisic acid ({ABA}) influences the expression of thousands of genes, allowing us to characterize complex stress-responsive regulatory networks. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, we identified genome-wide targets of 21 {ABA}-related {TFs} to construct a comprehensive regulatory network in
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              . Determinants of dynamic {TF} binding and a hierarchy among {TFs} were defined, illuminating the relationship between differential gene expression patterns and {ABA} pathway feedback regulation. By extrapolating regulatory characteristics of observed canonical {ABA} pathway components, we identified a new family of transcriptional regulators modulating {ABA} and salt responsiveness and demonstrated their utility to modulate plant resilience to osmotic stress.},

After their internalization, these proteins arrive at an early endosome, which then matures into a late endosome with intraluminal vesicles (multivesicular body, {MVB}) before fusing with the lysosome/vacuole in animals or yeast [1, 2]. The endosomal maturation step involves a {SAND} family protein mediating Rab5-to-Rab7 {GTPase} conversion [3]. Vacuolar trafﬁcking is much less well understood in plants [4–6]. Here we analyze the role of the single-copy {SAND} gene of Arabidopsis. In contrast to its animal or yeast counterpart, Arabidopsis {SAND} protein is not required for early-to-late endosomal maturation, although its role in mediating Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion is conserved. Instead, Arabidopsis {SAND} protein is essential for the subsequent fusion of {MVBs} with the vacuole. The inability of sand mutant to mediate {MVB}-vacuole fusion is not caused by the continued Rab5 activity but rather reﬂects the failure to activate Rab7. In conclusion, regarding the endosomal passage of cargo proteins for degradation, a major difference between plants and nonplant organisms might result from the relative timing of endosomal maturation and {SAND}-dependent Rab {GTPase} conversion as a prerequisite for the fusion of late endosomes/{MVBs} with the lysosome/vacuole.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Endodermal suberin plays crucial roles in plant nutrition by forming barriers for the free diffusion of water and nutrients. Suberin formation is tightly regulated by exogenous and developmental cues, which independently control suberin deposition in the endodermis. A set of four {MYB} transcription factors, expressed in the endodermis and responding to suberin-inducing conditions, individually prompt suberization and include the {MYBs} required for suberin formation and regulation. Overexpressing these transcription factors specifically in the endodermis or mutating all four led to plants specifically overproducing or underproducing endodermal suberin, respectively. Physiological analysis of these plants allowed us to decipher the role of suberin independently of synthetic transgenes and other endodermal barriers.
          , 
            Suberin is a hydrophobic biopolymer that can be deposited at the periphery of cells, forming protective barriers against biotic and abiotic stress. In roots, suberin forms lamellae at the periphery of endodermal cells where it plays crucial roles in the control of water and mineral transport. Suberin formation is highly regulated by developmental and environmental cues. However, the mechanisms controlling its spatiotemporal regulation are poorly understood. Here, we show that endodermal suberin is regulated independently by developmental and exogenous signals to fine-tune suberin deposition in roots. We found a set of four {MYB} transcription factors ({MYB}41, {MYB}53, {MYB}92, and {MYB}93), each of which is individually regulated by these two signals and is sufficient to promote endodermal suberin. Mutation of these four transcription factors simultaneously through genome editing leads to a dramatic reduction in suberin formation in response to both developmental and environmental signals. Most suberin mutants analyzed at physiological levels are also affected in another endodermal barrier made of lignin (Casparian strips) through a compensatory mechanism. Through the functional analysis of these four {MYBs}, we generated plants allowing unbiased investigation of endodermal suberin function, without accounting for confounding effects due to Casparian strip defects, and were able to unravel specific roles of suberin in nutrient homeostasis.},

            Editor’s summary
            
              The sequence composition, chromatin structure, and transcriptional activity of a genome reflect billions of years of evolution. The introduction of foreign {DNA}, which can differ substantially from the host genome, often perturbs this evolutionary process. Meneu
              et al
              . have shown that, depending on their {GC} content, large {DNA} sequences from bacteria and eukaryotes introduced into budding yeast either mingle with other active yeast chromosomes or segregate into an inactive globular compartment (see the Perspective by Fudenberg and Ramani). This spontaneous segregation requires active transcription of the host genome, which is accurately predicted by the underlying {DNA} sequence. This suggests that chromatin compartmentalization emerged from acquired genomic sequence diversity. —Di Jiang

              {INTRODUCTION}
              The composition of genomic sequences, such as {GC} content, nucleotide motifs, and repeats, varies from one species to another and within the same genome. Composition correlates with gene transcriptional activity and chromosome organization, and all genome sequences have coevolved with the chromatin-associated complexes they encode to precisely regulate these two features. However, when foreign {DNA}—including exogenous mobile elements and natural or artificial genes—invades or integrates a host nucleus, it encounters regulatory mechanisms and rules under which it has not evolved. How host cells process and eventually adopt these unfamiliar exogenous sequences remains largely unexplored.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              
                We investigated chromatin assembly on foreign {DNA} sequences by integrating two types of {DNA} into
                Saccharomyces cerevisiae
                : megabase-long bacterial chromosomes and shorter eukaryotic sequences. We profiled chromatin composition, activity, and folding in these foreign {DNA} sequences and investigated the molecular mechanisms governing their adaptation to the host environment. Finally, we used machine learning models to identify sequence features that influence chromatin formation and activity on these integrated {DNA} molecules.
              
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              
                We found that bacterial {DNA} sequences form chromatin and are covered by nucleosomes, but that their transcriptional activity depends on sequence composition.  Exogenous sequences with a {GC} content mirroring the host sequence become actively transcribed and intermingle with transcriptionally active yeast chromosomes in the nuclear space. Transcription of these sequences follows the original bacterial gene orientation, suggesting an intrinsic directional bias that may facilitate their adaptation to the host environment. By contrast, {AT}-rich chromosomes adopt an inactive chromatin state characterized by longer nucleosome spacing and a globular tridimensional shape segregated from yeast chromosomes. These two chromatin states spontaneously emerged, partitioning the hybrid genome into spatially distinct nuclear compartments that mirror the euchromatin-heterochromatin compartmentalization of metazoans. Transcriptional inactivation and compartmentalization occur independently of both canonical H3K9me3 mediated heterochromatin—absent in
                S. cerevisiae
                —and of yeast {SIR}-mediated heterochromatin. Compartmentalization disappears when transcription is reduced, suggesting that this phenomenon may involve mechanical constraints or biochemical changes in the environment of active genes. During mitosis, compartmentalization is lost as chromatin is compacted by cohesin-mediated loops, paralleling the transient compartment disruption observed in metazoans at this stage.
              
              Deep learning models trained only on yeast chromosomes accurately predict chromatin composition and activity on foreign {DNA} based on the {DNA} sequence alone. This implies that the behavior of any {DNA} in a host cell follows deterministic sequence-based rules, which could help to predict the behavior of exogenous {DNA} not only during natural gene transfer events but also in synthetic genome engineering projects.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              The spontaneous formation of transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin compartments in a eukaryotic genome lacking such structures provides insights into their emergence during evolution. When foreign {DNA} sequences are integrated into the yeast genome, their underlying sequence composition determines their chromatin state and ability to recruit the host transcriptional machinery. These predictable sequence-specific properties highlight the fundamental links between {DNA} sequence composition, chromatin organization, and nuclear architecture. Such sequence-dependent features could have contributed to the emergence of bipartite compartmentalization of genomes during evolution, either by sequestering inactive genetic material or by facilitating the functional integration of active sequences, thus potentially creating reservoirs of genetic novelty.
              
                
                  Different fates of foreign chromosomes in a yeast nucleus.
                  Bacterial or eukaryotic chromosomes with a {GC} content similar to yeast sequences (in purple) become actively transcribed and intermingle with host chromosomes. By contrast, foreign chromosomes with a lower {GC} (in blue) form a distinct, transcriptionally silent globular compartment within the nucleus. This segregation requires active transcription but is independent of canonical heterochromatin formation.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanism by which patterned gene activity leads to mechanical deformation of cells and tissues to create complex forms is a major challenge for developmental biology. Plants offer advantages for addressing this problem because their cells do not migrate or rearrange during morphogenesis, which simplifies analysis. We synthesize results from experimental analysis and computational modeling to show how mechanical interactions between cellulose fibers translate through wall, cell, and tissue levels to generate complex plant tissue shapes. Genes can modify mechanical properties and stresses at each level, though the values and pattern of stresses differ from one level to the next. The dynamic cellulose network provides elastic resistance to deformation while allowing growth through fiber sliding, which enables morphogenesis while maintaining mechanical strength.

They thus explain how mechanical forces act on plant tissues at scales from molecular to macro. —{PJH}
          , 
            A review discusses how interactions between fibers in plant cell walls can lead to the generation of complex tissue shapes.
          , 
            
              {BACKGROUND}
              The growth and shape of plants depend on the mechanical properties of the plant’s mesh of interconnected cell walls. Because adhering cell walls prevent cell migrations, morphogenesis is simpler to study in plants than in animals. Spatiotemporal variations in the rates and orientations at which cell walls yield to mechanical stresses—ultimately powered by cell turgor pressure—underlie the development and diversity of plant forms. Here, we review new insights and points of current contention in our understanding of plant morphogenesis, starting from wall components and building up to cells and tissues.
            
            
              {ADVANCES}
              Recent modeling and experimental studies have enabled advances at four levels: fiber, wall, cell, and tissue. In moving up levels, a population of discrete components is typically abstracted to a continuum at the next level (e.g., fibers to wall, walls to cell, cells to tissue). These abstractions help to both clarify concepts and simplify simulations. Mechanical stresses operate at each level, but values are typically not the same from one level to the next.
              At the fiber level, growth corresponds to cellulose microfibrils sliding past each other, which is passively driven by turgor-induced tension. The rate of sliding depends on adhesion between microfibrils, whereas anisotropy reflects differences in the proportion of fibers in different orientations. Growth occurs preferentially in the direction of maximal microfibril stress.
              At the wall level, microfibril sliding corresponds to cell wall creep, at rates dependent on turgor, wall extensibility, thickness, and yield thresholds. Anisotropic mechanical properties can arise through orientation-selective synthesis of cellulose microfibrils, guided by microtubules. Creep is stimulated by the wall-loosening action of expansins, which increase extensibility and lower the yield threshold. Wall synthesis and loosening influence growth in complementary ways. Wall loosening increases growth rate with almost immediate effect, but unless wall synthesis increases in parallel, wall thickness declines over time, potentially weakening the wall. Wall synthesis requires a longer time scale to have a discernible growth effect but is critical for maintaining wall thickness and orienting anisotropy. By regulating loosening and synthesis separately, plants have the flexibility to produce rapid growth responses as well as control longer-term growth patterns and mechanical strength.
              At the cellular level, growth corresponds to irreversible deformations that are catalyzed by expansins and physically driven by mechanical stresses that arise from turgor acting on cell walls. Oriented cell growth depends on wall anisotropy and cell geometry, which in turn depend on the dynamics of microtubule alignment. Collisions between microtubules lead to self-organized alignments that may be influenced by cellular cues and cell geometry.
              At the tissue level, cell-cell adhesion combined with differential wall properties can lead to tissue-wide stresses. Tissue morphogenesis depends on coupling the mechanical properties of walls, cells, and tissues to regional patterning. Coupling may occur by regional gene activity that modifies rates of microfibril deposition, wall extensibility, and/or yield thresholds, and thus wall growth through creep. Regional gene activity may also provide tissue cues that orient microtubule alignments, and thus the orientations of growth anisotropy. Computational modeling, informed by developmental genetics, live imaging, and growth analysis, has shown how these principles can account for morphogenetic changes through mechanically connected tissue regions irreversibly growing at specified rates and orientations. Taken as a whole, the cellulose network at the fiber and wall level provides elastic resistance to deformation while allowing growth through creep, which enables morphogenesis at the cell and tissue level while maintaining mechanical strength.
            
            
              {OUTLOOK}
              A key question is how patterns of gene expression at the tissue level modify behaviors and mechanics at other levels to generate tissue morphogenesis. Although we outline broad principles for how this may operate, many of the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unresolved. Controversies remain over the role of pectins in controlling wall mechanics and in the role of mechanosensing, chemical signaling, and polarity in controlling orientations of growth. And although tissue-level models have been proposed to account for morphogenetic changes, many of the underlying components remain hypothetical. A further challenge is to determine how interactions across levels have been modified during evolution to give rise to the diversity of plant forms.
              Many of the principles described here may also be applicable to microbial and animal morphogenesis. Similar to plants, rates and orientations of cellular growth in these organisms depend on fibers in the wall or cell cortex that resist turgor. Controlled fiber sliding may play a key role, though in animals such sliding can be driven actively as well as passively. In animal tissues where cell rearrangements are limited, as during organogenesis, growth coordination and tissue stresses may operate similarly to plants. Thus, although the molecular players that control plant, animal, and microbial development are different, the mechanics of morphogenesis may share common principles.

	abstract = {Plants respond to mechanical stimuli to direct their growth and counteract environmental threats. Mechanical stimulation triggers rapid gene expression changes and affects plant appearance (thigmomorphogenesis) and flowering. Previous studies reported the importance of jasmonic acid ({JA}) in touch signaling. Here, we used reverse genetics to further characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying touch signaling. We show that Piezo mechanosensitive ion channels have no major role in touch-induced gene expression and thigmomorphogenesis. In contrast, the receptor-like kinase Feronia acts as a strong negative regulator of the {JA}-dependent branch of touch signaling. Last, we show that calmodulin-binding transcriptional activators {CAMTA}1/2/3 are key regulators of {JA}-independent touch signaling. {CAMTA}1/2/3 cooperate to directly bind the promoters and activate gene expression of {JA}-independent touch marker genes like
              {TCH}2
              and
              {TCH}4
              . In agreement,
              camta3
              mutants show a near complete loss of thigmomorphogenesis and touch-induced delay of flowering. In conclusion, we have now identified key regulators of two independent touch-signaling pathways.

However, the role of expansins in controlling {CW} biomechanical properties in specific tissues and organs remains elusive. We monitored hormonal responsiveness and spatial specificity of expression and localization of expansins predicted to be the direct targets of cytokinin signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We found {EXPANSIN}1 ({EXPA}1) homogenously distributed throughout the {CW} of columella/lateral root cap, while {EXPA}10 and {EXPA}14 localized predominantly at 3-cell boundaries in the epidermis/cortex in various root zones. {EXPA}15 revealed cell-type-specific combination of homogenous vs. 3-cell boundaries localization. By comparing Brillouin frequency shift and {AFM}-measured Young’s modulus, we demonstrated Brillouin light scattering ({BLS}) as a tool suitable for non-invasive in vivo quantitative assessment of {CW} viscoelasticity. Using both {BLS} and {AFM}, we showed that {EXPA}1 overexpression upregulated {CW} stiffness in the root transition zone ({TZ}). The dexamethasone-controlled {EXPA}1 overexpression induced fast changes in the transcription of numerous {CW}-associated genes, including several {EXPAs} and {XYLOGLUCAN}: {XYLOGLUCOSYL} {TRANSFERASEs} ({XTHs}), and associated with rapid pectin methylesterification determined by in situ Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy in the root {TZ}. The {EXPA}1-induced {CW} remodeling is associated with the shortening of the root apical meristem, leading to root growth arrest. Based on our results, we propose that expansins control root growth by a delicate orchestration of {CW} biomechanical properties, possibly regulating both {CW} loosening and {CW} remodeling.},

              The symbiotic interaction of plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal ({AM}) fungi is ancient and widespread. Plants provide {AM} fungi with carbon in exchange for nutrients and water, making this interaction a prime target for crop improvement. However, plant–fungal interactions are restricted to a small subset of root cells, precluding the application of most conventional functional genomic techniques to study the molecular bases of these interactions. Here we used single-nucleus and spatial {RNA} sequencing to explore both
              Medicago truncatula
              and
              Rhizophagus irregularis
              transcriptomes in {AM} symbiosis at cellular and spatial resolution. Integrated, spatially registered single-cell maps revealed infected and uninfected plant root cell types. We observed that cortex cells exhibit distinct transcriptome profiles during different stages of colonization by {AM} fungi, indicating dynamic interplay between both organisms during establishment of the cellular interface enabling successful symbiosis. Our study provides insight into a symbiotic relationship of major agricultural and environmental importance and demonstrates a paradigm combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics for the analysis of complex organismal interactions.},

              Cell type-specific mapping of element distribution is critical to fully understand how roots partition nutrients and toxic elements with aboveground parts. In this study, we developed a method that combines fluorescence-activated cell sorting ({FACS}) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ({ICP}-{MS}) to assess the ionome of different cell populations within
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              roots. The method reveals that most elements exhibit a radial concentration gradient increasing from the rhizodermis to inner cell layers, and detected previously unknown ionomic changes resulting from perturbed xylem loading processes. With this approach, we also identify a strong accumulation of manganese in trichoblasts of iron-deficient roots. We demonstrate that confining manganese sequestration in trichoblasts but not in endodermal cells efficiently retains manganese in roots, therefore preventing toxicity in shoots. These results indicate the existence of cell type-specific constraints for efficient metal sequestration in roots. Thus, our approach opens an avenue to investigate element compartmentation and transport pathways in plants.},

              Plant genomes encode a complex and evolutionary diverse regulatory grammar that forms the basis for most life on earth. A wealth of regulome and epigenome data have been generated in various plant species, but no common, standardized resource is available so far for biologists. Here, we present {ChIP}-Hub, an integrative web-based platform in the {ENCODE} standards that bundles {\textgreater}10,000 publicly available datasets reanalyzed from {\textgreater}40 plant species, allowing visualization and meta-analysis. We manually curate the datasets through assessing {\textasciitilde}540 original publications and comprehensively evaluate their data quality. As a proof of concept, we extensively survey the co-association of different regulators and construct a hierarchical regulatory network under a broad developmental context. Furthermore, we show how our annotation allows to investigate the dynamic activity of tissue-specific regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers) and their underlying sequence grammar. Finally, we analyze the function and conservation of tissue-specific promoters, enhancers and chromatin states using comparative genomics approaches. Taken together, the {ChIP}-Hub platform and the analysis results provide rich resources for deep exploration of plant {ENCODE}. {ChIP}-Hub is available at

We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop {CellChat}, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) data. {CellChat} predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, {CellChat} classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying {CellChat} to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit {CellChat} and a web-based Explorer (

Some of these methods ({ClearSee}, {TDE}, {PEA}-Clarity, etc.) were adapted to clear various plant species, with the focus on roots, leaves, shoot apical meristems, and floral parts. However, these methods have not been used in developing seeds beyond the early globular stage. Tissue clearing is problematic in post-globular seeds due to various apoplastic barriers and secondary metabolites. In this study, we compared six methods for their efficiency in clearing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds at post-globular embryonic stages. Three methods ({TDE}, {ClearSee}, and {ClearSee} alpha) have already been reported in plants, whereas the others ({fsDISCO}, {FAST}9, and {CHAPS} clear) are used in this context for the first time. These methods were assessed for seed morphological changes, clearing capacity, removal of tannins, and spectral properties. We tested each method in seeds from globular to mature stages. The pros and cons of each method are listed herein. {ClearSee} alpha appears to be the method of choice as it preserves seed morphology and prevents tannin oxidation. However, {FAST}9 with 60\% iohexol as a mounting medium is faster, clears better, and appears suitable for embryonic shape imaging. Our results may guide plant researchers to choose a suitable method for imaging fluorescent protein-labeled embryos in intact Arabidopsis seeds.},

Roots respond to transient water unavailability by temporarily ceasing branching through the acclimative response xerobranching. In this study, we report how a xerobranching stimulus triggers rapid changes of {ROS} levels in root nuclei, triggering redox-dependent multimerization of the auxin repressor protein {IAA}3. Mutations in specific cysteine residues of {IAA}3 disrupt redox-mediated multimerization and interaction with co-repressor {TPL}, thereby attenuating {IAA}3-mediated target gene repression. Other {AUX}/{IAA} proteins also vary in their redox-mediated multimerization, which reveals a regulatory mechanism that connects dynamic changes in cellular redox status to auxin signaling. Our study reveals how {ROS}, auxin, and water availability intersect and shape root adaptive responses, thereby maintaining phenotypic plasticity in plants.

            Editor’s summary
            
              As roots grow through soil, they must integrate information about their environment to generate internal signals to direct their growth. Reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) are often produced in response to stresses such as drought. Roy
              et al
              . uncovered a link between {ROS} and the phytohormone auxin during root responses to drought. The authors found that drought-induced {ROS} stimulate redox-dependent multimerization of the auxin-signaling protein {IAA}3. The formation of {IAA}3 multimers influences how these proteins interact with additional auxin-signaling machinery that can repress downstream gene expression. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how environmental cues can influence plant development.—Madeleine Seale
            
          , 
            
              {INTRODUCTION}
              Plasticity in branching patterns is a critical determinant of the foraging capacity of roots because water and nutrients are often heterogeneously distributed in their surrounding soil environment. When growing root tips lose contact with moist soil (e.g., in an air gap), roots temporarily cease branching until they reestablish contact with moist soil (called a xerobranching response). Hence, xerobranching is an acclimative response that enables roots to respond to spatial variation in soil water availability. Insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern xerobranching are relevant to approaches to mitigate the effects of climate change and water scarcity on plants.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              Despite growing appreciation for the role of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) during stress responses in plants, the precise mechanism by which these signals function in root tissues during abiotic stress remains poorly understood. The phytohormone auxin integrates multiple endogenous and environmental signals to maintain phenotypic plasticity in plants. Given that both {ROS} and auxin play crucial roles in regulating various plastic developmental responses, their intersection represents a key nexus of biological importance. A deeper understanding of this cross-talk will help us understand how different developmental responses such as xerobranching are coordinated in accordance with the dynamic changes in their environment.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              
                Respiratory burst oxidase homolog ({RBOH}) proteins are the major producers of {ROS} in plants. We therefore screened
                rboh
                mutants for xerobranching defects. Selected
                rboh
                mutants exhibited strong xerobranching defects. {ROS} biosensors revealed that exposure to air-gap conditions stimulates a rapid nuclear burst of hydrogen peroxide (H
                2
                O
                2
                ) within root apical tissues. Biochemical approaches revealed that the Aux/{IAA} transcriptional repressor protein {IAA}3 forms redox-dependent multimers through sulfhydryl bridges via four specific cysteines residues. Notably, redox responsiveness of {IAA}3 can be directly modulated by {RBOHs}. By generating a quadruple cysteine-to-serine substitution mutant of {IAA}3 (4C/S-{IAA}3), we demonstrated that multimerization through these specific cysteine residues is critical for {IAA}3 repressor function. At the molecular level, combinatorial cysteine-to-serine substitutions abrogated {IAA}3’s capacity to form multimers and abolished its interaction with the co-repressor {TOPLESS} ({TPL}). {TPL} is an evolutionarily conserved protein that inhibits transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases ({HDACs}) that deacetylate histones, causing a more compact, less accessible chromatin structure inhibitory for transcription. In the context of auxin signaling, the effectiveness of Aux/{IAAs} as transcriptional repressors is determined by their capacity to interact with {TPL} and recruit it to the target loci. Thus, the disruption of the 4C/S-{IAA}3–{TPL} interaction led to the de-repression of downstream auxin-responsive target genes. At the phenotypic level, attenuation of the gene repression capacity of the redox-insensitive 4C/S-{IAA}3 mutant led to inherently higher lateral root density and a failure to suppress lateral root formation in air gaps (xerobranching).
              
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              Taken together, our study reveals how {IAA}3 multimerization can decode elevated {ROS} triggered by environmental changes (low-water stress) through auxin-mediated plant developmental regulation (inhibition of lateral root development). Multimerization of transcriptional repressors can confer additional layers of regulation of target gene expression in a context-driven manner. The phenomenon of redox-dependent multimerization of {IAA}3 reveals how the {ROS} signaling mechanism has been adapted by plants during the course of evolution to fine-tune plastic responses according to cellular redox status. This research helps us understand how plants respond to low water, which is relevant because water scarcity exacerbated by global climate change is becoming a widespread problem that negatively affects plant growth and development.
              
                
                  Model of the proposed mechanism for {ROS}-modulated {IAA}3 multimerization in mediating the repression of lateral root development during xerobranching.
                  
                    Low-water stress, such as in the air gap, triggers an increase in the {ROS} levels that promotes redox-dependent multimerization of wild-type {IAA}3 ({WT}-{IAA}3) to form a specific pattern of higher-order multimers. These multimers are recruited at target promoter sites, such as
                    {LBD}16
                    , through their interaction with auxin response factor ({ARF}) proteins, such as {ARF}7, via the {SUMO}-{SIM} interaction. {WT}-{IAA}3 higher-order multimers provide an increased interface for interaction with {TOPLESS} ({TPL}), leading to robust repression of auxin-dependent gene expression during xerobranching in the air gap (double-headed red arrow), curtailing lateral root development. In the presence of water, such as moist agar, {ROS} is reduced to basal levels. Consequently {WT}-{IAA}3 does not form higher-order multimers. Hence, the recruitment of {TPL} to target loci is substantially reduced, which leads to de-repression of gene expression promoting lateral root development.},

When ectopically expressed in the endodermis, most {CASPLs} were able to integrate the {CASP} membrane domain, which suggests that {CASPLs} share with {CASPs} the propensity to form transmembrane scaffolds. Extracellular loops are not necessary for generating the scaffold, since {CASP}1 was still able to localize correctly when either one of the extracellular loops was deleted. The {CASP} first extracellular loop was found conserved in euphyllophytes but absent in plants lacking Casparian strips, an observation that may contribute to the study of Casparian strip and root evolution. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), {CASPL} showed specific expression in a variety of cell types, such as trichomes, abscission zone cells, peripheral root cap cells, and xylem pole pericycle cells.},

Using a phosphoproteomic strategy in

            roots, we identify an ultra-rapid auxin response system that targets over 1700 proteins, many within 30 seconds. Auxin response is chemically specific, requires known auxin-binding proteins, and targets various pathways. Through exploring its temporal dynamics, we infer auxin-triggered kinase-substrate networks and identify apoplastic {pH} changes as a target of signaling and as part of a relay mechanism. By generating a variety of phosphoproteomic datasets, integrated with structural information in a web-app, and by demonstrating analysis and inference strategies, we offer a resource to explore rapid and dynamic signaling in plants.},

            Lignin is a complex polymer deposited in the cell wall of specialised plant cells, where it provides essential cellular functions. Plants coordinate timing, location, abundance and composition of lignin deposition in response to endogenous and exogenous cues. In roots, a fine band of lignin, the Casparian strip encircles endodermal cells. This forms an extracellular barrier to solutes and water and plays a critical role in maintaining nutrient homeostasis. A signalling pathway senses the integrity of this diffusion barrier and can induce over-lignification to compensate for barrier defects. Here, we report that activation of this endodermal sensing mechanism triggers a transcriptional reprogramming strongly inducing the phenylpropanoid pathway and immune signaling. This leads to deposition of compensatory lignin that is chemically distinct from Casparian strip lignin. We also report that a complete loss of endodermal lignification drastically impacts mineral nutrients homeostasis and plant growth.},

	abstract = {Plant development relies on the precise coordination of cell growth, which is influenced by the mechanical constraints imposed by rigid cell walls. The hormone auxin plays a crucial role in regulating this growth by altering the mechanical properties of cell walls. During the post-embryonic formation of lateral roots, pericycle cells deep within the main root are triggered by auxin to resume growth and divide to form a new root. This growth involves a complex interplay between auxin, growth, and the resolution of mechanical conflicts with the overlying endodermis. However, the exact mechanisms by which this coordination is achieved are still unknown. Here, we propose a model that integrates tissue mechanics and auxin transport, revealing a connection between the auxin-induced relaxation of mechanical stress in the pericycle and auxin signalling in the endodermis. We show that the endodermis initially limits the growth of pericycle cells, resulting in a modest initial expansion. However, the associated stress relaxation is sufficient to redirect auxin to the overlying endodermis, which then actively accommodates the growth, allowing for the subsequent development of the lateral root. Our model uncovers that increased pericycle turgor and decreased endodermal resistance licence expansion of the pericycle and how the topology of the endodermis influences the formation of the new root. These findings highlight the interconnected relationship between mechanics and auxin flow during lateral root initiation, emphasizing the vital role of the endodermis in shaping root development through mechanotransduction and auxin signalling.},

            Organ formation is an essential process in plants and animals, driven by cell division and cell identity establishment. Root branching where lateral roots form along the primary root axis increases the root system and aids the capture of water and nutrients. We have discovered that tight control of the cell width is necessary to coordinate asymmetric cell divisions in cells that give rise to a new lateral root organ. Although biomechanical processes have been shown to play a role in plant organogenesis, including lateral root formation, our data give mechanistic insights into cell size control during lateral root initiation.
          , 
            
              In plants, postembryonic formation of new organs helps shape the adult organism. This requires the tight regulation of when and where a new organ is formed and a coordination of the underlying cell divisions. To build a root system, new lateral roots are continuously developing, and this process requires the tight coordination of asymmetric cell division in adjacent pericycle cells. We identified {EXPANSIN} A1 ({EXPA}1) as a cell wall modifying enzyme controlling the divisions marking lateral root initiation. Loss of
              {EXPA}1
              leads to defects in the first asymmetric pericycle cell divisions and the radial swelling of the pericycle during auxin-driven lateral root formation. We conclude that a localized radial expansion of adjacent pericycle cells is required to position the asymmetric cell divisions and generate a core of small daughter cells, which is a prerequisite for lateral root organogenesis.},

              ) in the Fabaceae family. These amazing structures are produced in phosphate‐deprived conditions and are made of hundreds of short roots also known as rootlets. White lupin is the only crop bearing {CRs} and is considered as the model species for {CR} studies. However, little information is available on {CRs} atypical development, including the molecular events that trigger their formation. To provide insights on {CR} formation, we performed an anatomical and cellular description of rootlet development in white lupin. Starting with a classic histological approach, we described rootlet primordium development and defined eight developmental stages from rootlet initiation to their emergence. Due to the major role of hormones in the developmental program of root system, we next focussed on auxin‐related mechanisms. We observed the establishment of an auxin maximum through rootlet development in transgenic roots expressing the

              root. We revealed a crucial contribution of the collapse of damaged cells in wound perception and detected an auxin increase specific to cells immediately adjacent to the wound. This localized auxin increase balances wound-induced cell expansion and restorative division rates in a dose-dependent manner, leading to tumorous overproliferation when the canonical {TIR}1 auxin signaling is disrupted. Auxin and wound-induced turgor pressure changes together also spatially define the activation of key components of regeneration, such as the transcription regulator {ERF}115. Our observations suggest that the wound signaling involves the sensing of collapse of damaged cells and a local auxin signaling activation to coordinate the downstream transcriptional responses in the immediate wound vicinity.},

	abstract = {Symmetric tissue alignment is pivotal to the functions of plant vascular tissue, such as long-distance molecular transport and lateral organ formation. During the vascular development of the Arabidopsis roots, cytokinins initially determine cell-type boundaries among vascular stem cells and subsequently promote cell proliferation to establish vascular tissue symmetry. Although it is unknown whether and how the symmetry of initially deﬁned boundaries is progressively reﬁned under tissue growth in plants, such boundary shapes in animal tissues are regulated by cell ﬂuidity, e.g., cell migration and intercalation, lacking in plant tissues. Here, we uncover that cell proliferation during vascular development produces anisotropic compressive stress, smoothing, and symmetrizing cell arrangement of the vascular-cell-type boundary. Mechanistically, the {GATA} transcription factor {HANABA}-{TARANU} cooperates with the type-B Arabidopsis response regulators to form an incoherent feedforward loop in cytokinin signaling. The incoherent feedforward loop ﬁne-tunes the position and frequency of vascular cell proliferation, which in turn restricts the source of mechanical stress to the position distal and symmetric to the boundary. By combinatorial analyses of mechanical simulations and laser cell ablation, we show that the spatially constrained environment of vascular tissue efﬁciently entrains the stress orientation among the cells to produce a tissue-wide stress ﬁeld. Together, our data indicate that the localized proliferation regulated by the cytokinin signaling circuit is decoded into a globally oriented mechanical stress to shape the vascular tissue symmetry, representing a reasonable mechanism controlling the boundary alignment and symmetry in tissue lacking cell ﬂuidity.},

We developed a simple, fluorescence microscopy-based method to detect the orientation of newly-synthesized cellulose microfibrils in epidermal peels of onion and Arabidopsis. It is based on Alexa Fluor 488-tagged carbohydrate binding module 3a ({CBM}3a) from Clostridium thermocellum which displayed a nearly 4-fold greater binding to cell walls at {pH} 5.5 compared with {pH} 8. Binding to isolated cellulose did not display this {pH} dependence. At {pH} 7.5 fibrillar patterns at the surface of the epidermal peels were visible, corresponding to the directionality of surface cellulose microfibrils, as verified by atomic force microscopy. The fibrillar pattern was not visible as the labeling intensity increased at lower {pH}. The {pH} of greatest cell wall labeling corresponds to the isoelectric point of {CBM}3a, suggesting that electrostatic forces limit {CBM}3a penetration into the wall. Consistent with this, digestion of the wall with pectate lyase to remove homogalacturonan increased labeling intensity. We conclude that electrostatic interactions strongly influence labeling of cell walls with {CBM}3 and potentially other proteins, holding implications for any work that relies on penetration of protein probes such as {CBMs}, antibodies, or enzymes into charged polymeric substrates.},

              Arabidopsis
              , the root clock regulates the spacing of lateral organs along the primary root through oscillating gene expression. The core molecular mechanism that drives the root clock periodicity and how it is modified by exogenous cues such as auxin and gravity remain unknown. We identified the key elements of the oscillator ({AUXIN} {RESPONSE} {FACTOR} 7, its auxin-sensitive inhibitor {IAA}18/{POTENT}, and auxin) that form a negative regulatory loop circuit in the oscillation zone. Through multilevel computer modeling fitted to experimental data, we explain how gene expression oscillations coordinate with cell division and growth to create the periodic pattern of organ spacing. Furthermore, gravistimulation experiments based on the model predictions show that external auxin stimuli can lead to entrainment of the root clock. Our work demonstrates the mechanism underlying a robust biological clock and how it can respond to external stimuli.},

Lateral root emergence has been well described at the cellular level but, until recently, the molecular mechanisms involved were unclear. Scientists in the 19th and 20th centuries hypothesized that the cell wall of the overlying tissues was modiﬁed by enzymes released by cells within the primordium. Recent studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana revealed the existence of a complex transcellular signalling network regulated by auxin that controls cell wall remodelling in cells overlying lateral root primordia. In the ﬁrst part of this review, early observations on the cell biology of lateral root formation and emergence are summarized, and in the following two sections recent observations in Arabidopsis that led to the identiﬁcation of the molecular mechanism regulating lateral root emergence are described.},

          , 
            The process by which plant cells expand and gain shape has presented a challenge for researchers. Current models propose that these processes are driven by turgor pressure acting on the cell wall. Using nanoimaging, we show that the cell wall contains pectin nanofilaments that possess an intrinsic expansion capacity. Additionally, we use growth models containing such structures to show that a complex plant cell shape can derive from chemically induced local and polarized expansion of the pectin nanofilaments without turgor-driven growth. Thus, the plant cell wall, outside of the cell itself, is an active participant in shaping plant cells. Extracellular matrix function may similarly guide cell shape in other kingdoms, including Animalia.},

Grasses encompass more than 10,000 species and cover more than 40\% of the world land area from tropical to temperate regions. Given that grasses also supply about a ﬁfth of the world’s dietary protein as cereal grains, unlocking the sources of phenotypic variation in B. distachyon is hence of prime interest in fundamental and applied research in agronomy, ecology and evolution. We present here the B. distachyon diversity panel, which encompasses 332 fully sequenced accessions covering the whole species distribution from Spain to Iraq. By combining population genetics, niche modeling and landscape genomics, we suggest that B. distachyon recolonized Europe and the Middle East following the last glacial maximum. Consequently, the species faced new environmental conditions which led to clear associations between bioclimatic variables and genetic factors as well as footprints of positive selection in the genome. Altogether, this genomic resource oﬀers a powerful alternative to Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the genetic bases of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in plants and more speciﬁcally in monocots.},

To characterize the genetic variability of wheat root architecture, the root and shoot traits of 200 durum and 715 bread wheat varieties were measured at a young stage on a high-throughput phenotyping platform. Heritability of platform traits ranged from 0.40 for root biomass in durum wheat to 0.82 for the number of tillers. Field phenotyping data for yield components and {SNP} genotyping were already available for all the genotypes. Taking differences in earliness into account, several significant correlations between root traits and field agronomic performances were found, suggesting that plants investing more resources in roots in some stressed environments favored water and nutrient uptake, with improved wheat yield. We identified 100 quantitative trait locus ({QTLs}) of root traits in the bread wheat panels and 34 in the durum wheat panel. Most colocalized with {QTLs} of traits measured in field conditions, including yield components and earliness for bread wheat, but only in a few environments. Stress and climatic indicators explained the differential effect of some platform {QTLs} on yield, which was positive, null, or negative depending on the environmental conditions. Modern breeding has led to deeper rooting but fewer seminal roots in bread wheat. The number of tillers has been increased in bread wheat, but decreased in durum wheat, and while the root-shoot ratio for bread wheat has remained stable, for durum wheat it has been increased. Breeding for root traits or designing ideotypes might help to maintain current yield while adapting to specific drought scenarios.},

            Root architecture is a major determinant of plant fitness and is under constant modification in response to favorable and unfavorable environmental stimuli. Beyond impacts on the primary root, the environment can alter the position, spacing, density, and length of secondary or lateral roots. Lateral root development is among the best-studied examples of plant organogenesis, yet there are still many unanswered questions about its earliest steps. Among the challenges faced in capturing these first molecular events is the fact that this process occurs in a small number of cells with unpredictable timing. Single-cell sequencing methods afford the opportunity to isolate the specific transcriptional changes occurring in cells undergoing this fate transition. Using this approach, we successfully captured the transcriptomes of initiating lateral root primordia in Arabidopsis thaliana and discovered many upregulated genes associated with this process. We developed a method to selectively repress target gene transcription in the xylem pole pericycle cells where lateral roots originate and demonstrated that the expression of several of these targets is required for normal root development. We also discovered subpopulations of cells in the pericycle and endodermal cell files that respond to lateral root initiation, highlighting the coordination across cell files required for this fate transition.},

              Brachypodium distachyon
              rooting process by monitoring root morphology, biomass production, and C/N ratios during developmental stages. To provide insight into gene regulation that accompanies root growth, we generated comprehensive transcript profiles of Brachypodium whole-root system at four developmental stages. Our data analysis revealed that multiple biological processes including trehalose metabolism and various families of transcription factors ({TFs}) were differentially expressed in root system during plant development. In particular, the {AUX}/{IAA}, {ERFs}, {WRKY}, {NAC}, and {MADS} {TF} family members were upregulated as plant entered the booting/heading stage, while {ARFs} and {GRFs} were downregulated suggesting these {TF} families as important factors involved in specific phases of rooting, and possibly in regulation of transition to plant reproductive stages. We identified several Brachypodium candidate root biomass-promoting genes and

              While prokaryotic pan-genomes have been shown to contain many more genes than any individual organism, the prevalence and functional significance of differentially present genes in eukaryotes remains poorly understood. Whole-genome de novo assembly and annotation of 54 lines of the grass
              Brachypodium distachyon
              yield a pan-genome containing nearly twice the number of genes found in any individual genome. Genes present in all lines are enriched for essential biological functions, while genes present in only some lines are enriched for conditionally beneficial functions (e.g., defense and development), display faster evolutionary rates, lie closer to transposable elements and are less likely to be syntenic with orthologous genes in other grasses. Our data suggest that differentially present genes contribute substantially to phenotypic variation within a eukaryote species, these genes have a major influence in population genetics, and transposable elements play a key role in pan-genome evolution.},

              Drought stress imposes severe challenges on agriculture by impacting crop performance. Understanding drought responses in plants at a cellular level is a crucial first step toward engineering improved drought resilience. However, the molecular responses to drought are complex as they depend on multiple factors, including the severity of drought, the profiled organ, its developmental stage or even the cell types therein. Thus, deciphering the transcriptional responses to drought is especially challenging. In this study, we investigated tissue‐specific responses to mild drought ({MD}) in young
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              (Arabidopsis) leaves using single‐cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}‐seq). To preserve transcriptional integrity during cell isolation, we inhibited {RNA} synthesis using the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, and demonstrated the benefits of transcriptome fixation for studying mild stress responses at a single‐cell level. We present a curated and validated single‐cell atlas, comprising 50 797 high‐quality cells from almost all known cell types present in the leaf. All cell type annotations were validated with a new library of reporter lines. The curated data are available to the broad community in an intuitive tool and a browsable single‐cell atlas (
              http://www.single‐cell.be/plant/leaf‐drought
              ). We show that the mesophyll contains two spatially separated cell populations with distinct responses to drought: one enriched in canonical abscisic acid‐related drought‐responsive genes, and another one enriched in genes involved in iron starvation responses. Our study thus reveals a dual adaptive mechanism of the leaf mesophyll in response to {MD} and provides a valuable resource for future research on stress responses.},

	abstract = {The root systems of land plants mine the soil for water and essential edaphic nutrients that are needed for the vegetative and reproductive phases of shoot growth. Different root system architectures exist across the angiosperms, and while there are many variants, two principal layouts are associated with the monocotyledon-dicotyledon divide: whereas a primary taproot and its branch roots typically dominate dicotyledon root systems, monocotyledon root systems appear overall more complex and are typically dominated by post-embryonic shootborne roots. Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) displays all the characteristics of a monocotyledon root system; however its complexity is minimal as compared to many other monocotyledon species, notably crops. Together with its relatively small size, this makes the Brachypodium root system a tractable model for monocotyledon root development that can be easily investigated in tissue culture but also in soil. First molecular genetic and physiological studies already point to distinct regulatory mechanisms and environmental responses in Brachypodium as compared to well-characterized dicotyledon model species. These results highlight the worthwhileness of studying the Brachypodium root system and its value as a credible model to decipher major evolutionarydevelopmental facets of angiosperm root system diversity. Moreover, the fact that Brachypodium is a wild plant that has not undergone human selection contrasts with the crops that serve as key monocotyledon models so far. Therefore, analysis of Brachypodium can be instructive with respect to root traits that have been modiﬁed or lost during crop domestication, especially in the closely related temperate cereals, barley, rye and wheat. Combined with natural germplasm collections, Brachypodium is thus an ideal model to investigate ecological, evolutionary and developmental aspects of monocotyledon root systems and their relation to crop performance.},

In dicots, for example, after plants adapted from aquatic to terrestrial environments, filamentous pseudorhizae evolved to allow nutrient absorption. A typical plant root system comprises a primary root, {LRs}, root hairs, and a root cap. Classical plant roots exhibit geotropism (the tendency to grow downward into the ground) and can synthesize plant hormones and other essential substances. Root vascular bundles and complex spatial structures enable plants to absorb water and nutrients to meet their nutrient quotas and grow. The primary root carries out most functions during early growth stages but is later overtaken by {LRs}, underscoring the importance of {LR} development water and mineral uptake and the soil fixation capacity of the root. {LR} development is modulated by endogenous plant hormones and external environmental factors, and its underlying mechanisms have been dissected in great detail in Arabidopsis, thanks to its simple root anatomy and the ease of obtaining mutants. This review comprehensively and systematically summarizes past research (largely in Arabidopsis) on {LR} basic structure, development stages, and molecular mechanisms regulated by different factors, as well as future prospects in {LR} research, to provide broad background knowledge for root researchers.},

Compensatory {LR} growth contributes to maintaining total root length ({TRL}) and hence water and nutrient uptake in compacted soils. However, it remains unclear how shoot and root phenotypic traits change during the compensatory growth and whether there are genotypic variations in compensatory root growth. This study analyzed shoot and root morphological traits of 20 rice genotypes, which includes mutants with altered root morphology, during the vegetative stage using a semihydroponic phenotyping system. The phenotyping experiment detected large variation in root and shoot traits among the 20 genotypes. Morphological changes induced by root cutting were analyzed in six selected genotypes with contrasting root system architecture. Root cutting significantly affected root distribution along vertical sections and among diameter classes. After root cutting, more roots distributed at shallower depth and thicker {LRs} developed. Furthermore, genotypes with deeper root growth without root cutting allocated more compensatory roots to deeper sections even after root cutting than the genotypes with shallower rooting. Due to the compensatory {LR} growth, root cutting did not significantly affect {TRL}, root dry weight ({RDW}), or shoot dry weight ({SDW}). To analyze the interaction between crown root ({CR}) number and compensatory root growth, we removed half of the newly emerged {CRs} in two genotypes. {TRL} of {YRL}38 increased at depth with {CR} number manipulation ({CRM}) regardless of root tip excision, which was attributed to an increase in specific root length ({SRL}), despite no change in {RDW}. Taken together, the tested rice genotypes exhibited compensatory root growth by changing root distribution at depth and in diameter classes. Reducing {CR} number promoted root development and compensatory growth by improving the efficiency of root development [root length ({RL}) per resource investment].},

              Cell‐specific transcriptional regulatory networks ({TRNs}) play vital roles in plant development and response to environmental stresses. However, traditional single‐cell mono‐omics techniques are unable to directly capture the relationships and dynamics between different layers of molecular information within the same cells. While advanced algorithm facilitates merging {scRNA}‐seq and {scATAC}‐seq datasets, accurate data integration remains a challenge, particularly when investigating cell‐type‐specific {TRNs}. By examining gene expression and chromatin accessibility simultaneously in 16,670
              Arabidopsis
              root tip nuclei, the {TRNs} are reconstructed that govern root tip development under osmotic stress. In contrast to commonly used computational integration at cell‐type level, 12,968 peak‐to‐gene linkage is captured at the bona fide single‐cell level and construct {TRNs} at an unprecedented resolution. Furthermore, the unprecedented datasets allow to more accurately reconstruct the coordinated changes of gene expression and chromatin states during cellular state transition. During root tip development, chromatin accessibility of initial cells precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for subsequent differentiation steps. Pseudo‐time trajectory analysis reveal that osmotic stress can shift the functional differentiation of trichoblast. Candidate stress‐related gene‐linked cis‐regulatory elements (gl‐{cCREs}) as well as potential target genes are also identified, and uncovered large cellular heterogeneity under osmotic stress.},

              . Root systems can adapt to contrasting soil conditions and stresses, yet how their responses are programmed at the individual cell scale remains unclear. Using single-cell {RNA} sequencing and spatial transcriptomic approaches, we showed major expression changes in outer root cell types when comparing the single-cell transcriptomes of rice roots grown in gel versus soil conditions. These tissue-specific transcriptional responses are related to nutrient homeostasis, cell wall integrity and defence in response to heterogeneous soil versus homogeneous gel growth conditions. We also demonstrate how the model soil stress, termed compaction, triggers expression changes in cell wall remodelling and barrier formation in outer and inner root tissues, regulated by abscisic acid released from phloem cells. Our study reveals how root tissues communicate and adapt to contrasting soil conditions at single-cell resolution.},

Here, we mapped the transcriptional heterogeneity of {lncRNAs} and their associated gene regulatory networks at single-cell resolution. We generated a comprehensive cell atlas at the whole-organism level by integrative analysis of 28 published single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) datasets from juvenile Arabidopsis seedlings. We then provided an in-depth analysis of cell-type-related {lncRNA} signatures that show expression patterns consistent with canonical protein-coding gene markers. We further demonstrated that the cell-type-speciﬁc expression of {lncRNAs} largely explains their tissue speciﬁcity. In addition, we predicted gene regulatory networks on the basis of motif enrichment and co-expression analysis of {lncRNAs} and {mRNAs}, and we identiﬁed putative transcription factors orchestrating cell-type-speciﬁc expression of {lncRNAs}. The analysis results are available at the single-cell-based plant {lncRNA} atlas database ({scPLAD}; https://biobigdata.nju.edu.cn/{scPLAD}/).

A comprehensive analysis of 17 {RSA} traits showed high variability among the different accessions, unveiling correlations between traits and conditions of the natural habitat of the plants. A sub-selection of these accessions was grown in water-limiting conditions in a rhizotron set-up, which revealed that especially the spatial distribution showed a high consistency between in vitro and ex vitro conditions, while in particular, a large root area in the lower zone favored drought tolerance. The collected {RSA} phenotype data were used to perform genomewide association studies ({GWAS}), which stands out from the previous studies by its exhaustive measurements of {RSA} traits on more mature Arabidopsis accessions used for {GWAS}. As a result, we found not only several genes involved in the lateral root ({LR}) development or auxin signaling pathways to be associated with {RSA} traits but also new candidate genes that are potentially involved in the adaptation to the natural habitats.},

In this study, we performed the single-cell {RNA} sequencing through the ﬁrst four stages of {LR} formation in Arabidopsis. Our analysis led to a model in which a single group of precursor cells, with a cell identity different from their pericycle origins, rapidly reprograms and splits into a mixed ground tissue/stem cell niche fate and a vascular precursor fate. The ground tissue and stem cell niche fates soon separate and a subset of more specialized vascular cells form sucrose transporting phloem cells that appear to connect to the primary root. We did not detect cells resembling epidermis or root cap, suggesting that outer tissues may form later, preceding {LR} emergence. At this stage, some remaining initial precursor cells form the primordium ﬂanks, while the rest create a reservoir of pluripotent cells that are able to replace the {LR} if damaged. Laser ablation of the central and lateral {LRP} regions showed that remaining cells restart the sequence of tissue initiation to form a {LR}. Collectively, our study reveals an ontological hierarchy for {LR} formation with an early and sequential split of main root tissues and stem cells.},

The auxin inducible auxin influx carrier {LAX}3 plays a key role concentrating this signal in cells overlying {LRP}. Delimiting {LAX}3 expression to two adjacent cell files overlying new {LRP} is critical to ensure auxin-regulated cell separation occurs solely along their shared walls. Multiscale modeling has predicted this highly focused pattern of expression requires auxin to sequentially induce auxin efflux and influx carriers {PIN}3 and {LAX}3, respectively. Consistent with model predictions, we report that {LAX}3 auxin inducible expression is regulated indirectly by the {AUXIN} {RESPONSE} {FACTOR} {ARF}7. Yeast-1-hybrid screens revealed the {LAX}3 promoter is bound by the transcription factor {LBD}29, which is a direct target for regulation by {ARF}7. Disrupting auxin inducible {LBD}29 expression or expressing an {LBD}29-{SRDX} transcriptional repressor phenocopied the lax3 mutant, resulting in delayed lateral root emergence. We conclude that sequential {LBD}29 and {LAX}3 induction by auxin is required to coordinate cell separation and organ emergence.},

	abstract = {Analysis of Brachypodium mutants with increased cellular steady state auxin content and root cell elongation sheds light on the importance of the Acid Growth Theory of plant cell elongation in roots., The long-standing Acid Growth Theory of plant cell elongation posits that auxin promotes cell elongation by stimulating cell wall acidification and thus expansin action. To date, the paucity of pertinent genetic materials has precluded thorough analysis of the importance of this concept in roots. The recent isolation of mutants of the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon with dramatically enhanced root cell elongation due to increased cellular auxin levels has allowed us to address this question. We found that the primary transcriptomic effect associated with elevated steady state auxin concentration in elongating root cells is upregulation of cell wall remodeling factors, notably expansins, while plant hormone signaling pathways maintain remarkable homeostasis. These changes are specifically accompanied by reduced cell wall arabinogalactan complexity but not by increased proton excretion. On the contrary, we observed a tendency for decreased rather than increased proton extrusion from root elongation zones with higher cellular auxin levels. Moreover, similar to Brachypodium, root cell elongation is, in general, robustly buffered against external {pH} fluctuation in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, forced acidification through artificial proton pump activation inhibits root cell elongation. Thus, the interplay between auxin, proton pump activation, and expansin action may be more flexible in roots than in shoots.},

	abstract = {A decade has passed since {SUMO} (small ubiquitin-related modifier) was discovered to be a reversible post-translational protein modifier. During this time many enzymes that participate in regulated {SUMO}-conjugation and -deconjugation pathways have been identified and characterized. In parallel, the search for {SUMO} substrates has produced a long list of targets, which appear to be involved in most cellular functions. Sumoylation is a highly dynamic process and its outcomes are extremely diverse, ranging from changes in localization to altered activity and, in some cases, stability of the modified protein. At first glance, these effects have nothing in common; however, it seems that they all result from changes in the molecular interactions of the sumoylated proteins.},

Therefore, these technologies are gaining traction in plant molecular and developmental biology for elucidating the transcriptional changes across cell types in a specific tissue or organ, upon treatments, in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, or between genotypes. Despite the rapidly accelerating use of these technologies, collective and standardized experimental and analytical procedures to support the acquisition of high-quality data sets are still missing. In this commentary, we discuss common challenges associated with the use of single-cell transcriptomics in plants and propose general guidelines to improve reproducibility, quality, comparability, and interpretation and to make the data readily available to the community in this fast-developing field of research.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            Spatial accommodation, the ability of plant tissues to adapt structurally during organogenesis, is important for the successful growth and emergence of new organs, such as lateral roots, through overlying cell layers. This process requires precise coordination between cellular architecture and physical as well as biochemical signals. As a key determinant of root system architecture, auxin is also an important regulator of spatial accommodation. Of these responses, the modulation of the cytoskeleton dynamics and cell wall remodeling across multiple tissue layers is of particular importance. Here, we focus on how auxin signaling controls these dynamics to enable tissue‐scale plasticity during lateral root emergence. We also compare how these mechanisms vary across plant lineages, highlighting the differences between dicots and monocots, but also non‐vascular plants.},
